indicating that LPR should be at least as accurate as GAMs and GPs for
p-times differentiable processes \parencite{fan_local_1997}. It is however
unclear whether these results generalize to the non-differentiable processes
that we suspect can be found most often in psychology. Lastly, the tested
polynomial regression inferred the underlying processes least accurately. This appeared
to be due to numerical model instability that resulted in underfitting, since
not enough higher-order terms could be included in the models, and due to
divergence towards the ends of the timeseries. The numerical model instability
can be mitigated by using orthogonal polynomials, which are however more
difficult to interpret. Generally, there appears to be no reason to use
a global polynomial regression instead of a GAM, in any situation in which
prior theory does not strongly suggest that the process follows a low order
polynomial trajectory.
