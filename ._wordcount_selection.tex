% Rewrite
The latter is calculated by removing one data point, refitting
the model while keeping certain parameters fixed, predicting the left-out
observation, and calculating the squared prediction error. By repeating this
procedure for each data point and averaging the squared errors, leave-one-out
cross-validation provides an estimate of how accurately the model predicts
unobserved values within the design range.
