	abstract = {Both the dynamic approach and catastrophe modeling have been warmly welcomed in research on attitudes and opinions. In this article, the authors discuss a general methodology for testing catastrophe models and apply it to the dynamics of attitude formation and change. First, by making use of the so-called catastrophe flags, converging support for the catastrophe model can be attained. Each flag relates to a specific hypothesis about attitudinal change. Second, fitting stochastic catastrophe models to data enables one to carry out a direct test of catastrophe models. Results of analyzing large data sets on political attitudes support the validity of the general catastrophe model of attitude change in which transitions in attitudes are a function of involvement and information. Present results suggest that in the case of political attitudes, involvement might well be correlated with attitude. A more refined approach to the measurement of information and involvement is suggested.},

	abstract = {Understanding temporal change in human behavior and psychological processes is a central issue in the behavioral sciences. With technological advances, intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are increasingly generated by studies of human behavior that repeatedly administer assessments over time. ILD offer unique opportunities to describe temporal behavioral changes in detail and identify related environmental and psychosocial antecedents and consequences. Traditional analytical approaches impose strong parametric assumptions about the nature of change in the relationship between time-varying covariates and outcomes of interest. This article introduces time-varying effect models (TVEMs) that explicitly model changes in the association between ILD covariates and ILD outcomes over time in a flexible manner. In this article, we describe unique research questions that the TVEM addresses, outline the model-estimation procedure, share a SAS macro for implementing the model, demonstrate model utility with a simulated example, and illustrate model applications in ILD collected as part of a smoking-cessation study to explore the relationship between smoking urges and self-efficacy during the course of the pre- and postcessation period.},

	abstract = {In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric TV-AR model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the TV-AR model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the TV-AR model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology.},

The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientifically useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person's network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

Using simulations, we show how the theoretical Ising model captures local-alignment dynamics. Subsequently, we present it statistically as a likelihood function for estimating empirical network models from binary data. In this process, we give recommendations on when to use traditional frequentist estimators as well as novel Bayesian options.},

The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of the meaning and interpretation of the parameters in LCS models. Importantly, we focus on their relation to the shape of the trajectories and explain how different speciﬁcations of the LCS model involve particular assumptions about the mechanisms of change. On a supplementary website, we present an interactive Shiny App that allows users to explore different sets of parameter values and examine their effects on the predicted trajectories.

To address reciprocal effects, a variety of longitudinal models that include cross-lagged relations have been proposed in different contexts and disciplines. However, the relations between these cross-lagged models have not been systematically discussed in the literature. This lack of insight makes it difficult for researchers to select an appropriate model when analyzing longitudinal data, and some researchers do not even think about alternative cross-lagged models. The present research provides a unified framework that clarifies the conceptual and mathematical similarities and differences between these models. The unified framework shows that existing longitudinal models can be effectively classified based on whether the model posits unique factors and/or dynamic residuals and what types of common factors are used to model changes. The latter is essential to understand how cross-lagged parameters are interpreted. We also present an example using empirical data to demonstrate that there is great risk of drawing different conclusions depending on the cross-lagged models used.},

This paper aims to present an approachable, non-technical overview of the state of the art on these challenges and the solutions that have been proposed, with emphasis on application towards psychosomatic hypotheses. Speciﬁcally, we elaborate on issues related to measurement intervals, the number and nature of the variables used in the analysis, modeling stable and changing processes, concurrent relationships, and extending time series analysis to incorporate the data of multiple individuals. We also brieﬂy discuss some general modeling issues, such as lag-speciﬁcation, sample size and time series length, and the role of measurement errors.

Along with the increased prevalence of ILD, more methods are being developed to analyze these data. However, relatively few methods have yet been applied for making long- or even short-term predictions from ILD in behavioral settings. Applications of forecasting methods to behavioral ILD are still scant. We first establish a general framework for modeling ILD and then extend that frame to two previously existing forecasting methods: these methods are Kalman prediction and ensemble prediction. After implementing Kalman and ensemble forecasts in free and open-source software, we apply these methods to daily drug and alcohol use data. In doing so, we create a simple, but nonlinear dynamical system model of daily drug and alcohol use and illustrate important differences between the forecasting methods. We further compare the Kalman and ensemble forecasting methods to several simpler forecasts of daily drug and alcohol use. Ensemble forecasts may be more appropriate than Kalman forecasts for nonlinear dynamical systems models, but further forecasting evaluation methods must be put into practice.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the application to field measurements of time series methods developed on the basis of the theory of deterministic chaos. The major difficulties are pointed out that arise when the data cannot be assumed to be purely deterministic and the potential that remains in this situation is discussed. For signals with weakly nonlinear structure, the presence of nonlinearity in a general sense has to be inferred statistically. The paper reviews the relevant methods and discusses the implications for deterministic modeling. Most field measurements yield nonstationary time series, which poses a severe problem for their analysis. Recent progress in the detection and understanding of nonstationarity is reported. If a clear signature of approximate determinism is found, the notions of phase space, attractors, invariant manifolds, etc., provide a convenient framework for time series analysis. Although the results have to be interpreted with great care, superior performance can be achieved for typical signal processing tasks. In particular, prediction and filtering of signals are discussed, as well as the classification of system states by means of time series recordings.},

Despite their relevance, many neuroscientists still apply linear estimates in order to evaluate complex interactions. This is partially due to the lack of a comprehensive compilation of non-linear methods. Available packages mostly specialize in only one aspect of non-linear time-series analysis and most often require some coding proficiency to use. Here, we introduce NoLiTiA, a free open-source MATLAB toolbox for non-linear time series analysis. In comparison to other currently available non-linear packages, NoLiTiA offers (1) an implementation of a broad range of classic and recently developed methods, (2) an implementation of newly proposed spatially and time-resolved recurrence amplitude analysis and (3) an intuitive environment accessible even to users with little coding experience due to a graphical user interface and batch-editor. The core methodology derives from three distinct fields of complex systems theory, including dynamical systems theory, recurrence quantification analysis and information theory. Besides established methodology including estimation of dynamic invariants like Lyapunov exponents and entropy-based measures, such as active information storage, we include recent developments of quantifying time-resolved aperiodic oscillations. In general, the toolbox will make non-linear methods accessible to the broad neuroscientific community engaged in time series processing.},

To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

Here, we aim to clarify the relationship between the within- and between-person distinction and causal inference, and show that the distinction is informative but does not play a decisive role in causal inference. Our main points are threefold. First, within-person data are not necessary for causal inference; for example, between-person experiments can inform us about (average) causal effects. Second, within-person data are not sufficient for causal inference; for example, time-varying confounders can lead to spurious within-person associations. Finally, despite not being sufficient, withinperson data can be tremendously helpful for causal inference. We provide pointers to help readers navigate the more technical literature on longitudinal models, and conclude with a call for more conceptual clarity: Instead of letting statistical models dictate which substantive questions we ask, we should start with well-defined theoretical estimands which in turn determine both study design and data analysis.},

In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes and differential equations to combine data driven modeling with a physical model of the system. We show how different, physically-inspired, kernel functions  can be developed through sensible, simple, mechanistic assumptions about the underlying system.

Existing time-series methods often have limitations, such as assuming linear interactions or having restricted forms, leading to difficulties in capturing the complex nature of these systems. To address this issue, we introduce fitlandr, a method with implementation as an R package that integrates nonparametric estimation of the drift-diffusion function and stability landscape. The drift-diffusion function is estimated using the Multivariate Kernel Estimator (MVKE, Bandi \& Moloche, 2018), and the stability landscape is estimated through Monte-Carlo estimation of the steady-state distribution (Cui et al., 2021, 2022). Using a simulated emotional system, we demonstrate that fitlandr can effectively recover bistable dynamics from data, even in the presence of moderate noise, and that it primarily relies on dynamic information from the system instead of distributional information. We then apply the method to two empirical single-participant ESM datasets and compared the results with the simulation datasets. Whereas both datasets show a bimodal distribution, fitlandr only revealed bistability in one of them, indicating that bimodality in ILD does not necessarily imply the existence of bistability in the underlying system. These results demonstrate the potential of fitlandr as a tool for uncovering the rich, nonlinear dynamics of psychological systems from ILD.},

However, the existing inference techniques associated with these models rely on the exact computation of posterior kernel terms which are seldom available in analytical form. Most applications relevant to practitioners, such as Hill equations or diffusion equations, are hence intractable. In this paper, we overcome these computational problems by proposing a variational solution to a general class of non-linear and parabolic partial differential equation latent force models. Further, we show that a neural operator approach can scale our model to thousands of instances, enabling fast, distributed computation. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our framework by achieving competitive performance on several tasks where the kernels are of varying degrees of tractability.},

	abstract = {The problem of combined state and input estimation of linear structural systems based on measured responses and a priori knowledge of structural model is considered. A novel methodology using Gaussian process latent force models is proposed to tackle the problem in a stochastic setting. Gaussian process latent force models (GPLFMs) are hybrid models that combine differential equations representing a physical system with data-driven non-parametric Gaussian process models. In this work, the unknown input forces acting on a structure are modelled as Gaussian processes with some chosen covariance functions which are combined with the mechanistic differential equation representing the structure to construct a GPLFM. The GPLFM is then conveniently formulated as an augmented stochastic state-space model with additional states representing the latent force components, and the joint input and state inference of the resulting model is implemented using Kalman ﬁlter. The augmented state-space model of GPLFM is shown as a generalization of the class of input-augmented state-space models, is proven observable, and is robust against drift in force estimation compared to conventional augmented formulations. The hyperparameters governing the covariance functions are estimated using maximum likelihood optimization based on the observed data, thus overcoming the need for manual tuning of the hyperparameters by trial-and-error. To assess the performance of the proposed GPLFM method, several cases of state and input estimation are demonstrated using numerical simulations on a 10-dof shear building and a 76-storey ASCE benchmark ofﬁce tower. Results obtained indicate the superior performance of the proposed approach over conventional Kalman ﬁlter based approaches.},

	abstract = {State–space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture–recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. We present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

However, functional data observed over time with serial dependence remains a less studied area. Motivated by Bosq (2000), who first introduced the functional autoregressive models, we propose a convolutional functional autoregressive model, where the function at time t is a result of the sum of convolutions of the past functions and a set of convolution functions, plus a noise process, mimicking the vector autoregressive process. It provides an intuitive and direct interpretation of the dynamics of a stochastic process. Instead of principal component analysis commonly used in functional data analysis, we adopt a sieve estimation procedure based on B-spline approximation of the convolution functions. We establish convergence rate of the proposed estimator, and investigate its theoretical properties. The model building, model validation, and prediction procedures are also developed. Both simulated and real data examples are presented.},

More recently, recurrence plots, initially proposed as a visual tool for the analysis of complex systems, have proven to be a powerful framework to quantify and reveal nontrivial dynamical features in time series data. This tutorial review provides a brief introduction to the fundamentals of nonlinear time series analysis, before discussing in greater detail a few (out of the many existing) approaches of recurrence plot-based analysis of time series. In particular, it focusses on recurrence plot-based measures which characterize dynamical features such as determinism, synchronization, and regime changes. The concept of surrogate-based hypothesis testing, which is crucial to drawing any inference from data analyses, is also discussed. Finally, the presented recurrence plot approaches are applied to two climatic indices related to the equatorial and North Paciﬁc regions, and their dynamical behavior and their interrelations are investigated.},

Many of the subject-specific biomedical systems can be described by a set of differential or difference equations which are similar to engineering dynamic systems. In this paper, motivated by HIV dynamic studies, we propose a class of mixed-effects state space models based on the longitudinal feature of dynamic systems. State space models with mixed-effects components are very flexible in modelling the serial correlation of within-subject observations and between-subject variations. The Bayesian approach and the maximum likelihood method for standard mixed-effects models and state space models are modified and investigated for estimating unknown parameters in the proposed models. In the Bayesian approach, full conditional distributions are derived and the Gibbs sampler is constructed to explore the posterior distributions. For the maximum likelihood method we develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with a Gibbs sampler step to approximate the conditional expectations in the E-step. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the two proposed methods. We apply the mixed-effects state space model to a data set from an AIDS clinical trial to illustrate the proposed methodologies. The proposed models and methods may also have potential applications in other biomedical system analyses such as tumor dynamics in cancer research and genetic regulatory network modeling.},

	title = {Mathematical and {Computational} {Modeling} of {Suicide} as a {Complex} {Dynamical} {System}},
	url = {https://osf.io/b29cs},
	abstract = {Background: Despite decades of research, the current suicide rate is nearly identical to what it was 100 years ago. This slow progress is due, at least in part, to a lack of formal theories of suicide. Existing suicide theories are instantiated verbally, omitting details required for precise explanation and prediction, rendering them difficult to effectively evaluate and difficult to improve. By contrast, formal theories are instantiated mathematically and computationally, allowing researchers to precisely deduce theory predictions, rigorously evaluate what the theory can and cannot explain, and thereby, inform how the theory can be improved. This paper takes the first step toward addressing the need for formal theories in suicide research by formalizing an initial, general theory of suicide and evaluating its ability to explain suicide-related phenomena.Methods: First, we formalized a General Escape Theory of Suicide as a system of stochastic and ordinary differential equations. Second, we used these equations to simulate behavior of the system over time. Third, we evaluated if the formal theory produced robust suicide-related phenomena including rapid onset and brief duration of suicidal thoughts, and zero-inflation of suicidal thinking in time series data.Results: Simulations successfully produced the proposed suicidal phenomena (i.e., rapid onset, short duration, and high zero-inflation of suicidal thoughts in time series data). Notably, these simulations also produced theorized phenomena following from the General Escape Theory of Suicide: that suicidal thoughts emerge when alternative escape behaviors failed to effectively regulate aversive internal states, and that effective use of long-term strategies may prevent the emergence of suicidal thoughts.  Conclusions: To our knowledge, the model developed here is the first formal theory of suicide, which was able to produce – and, thus, explain – well-established phenomena documented in the suicide literature. We discuss the next steps in a research program dedicated to studying suicide as a complex dynamical system, and describe how the integration of formal theories and empirical research may advance our understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicide.},

	abstract = {Psychological theories often invoke interactions but remain vague regarding the details. As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

Previously, researchers eyeballed idiographic networks, computed correlations between idiographic networks, as well as used techniques that make use of the multilevel structure of the data (e.g., GIMME and mlVAR) to investigate individual differences. However, these methods do not allow for testing the equality of idiographic network structures directly. In this paper, we propose the Individual Network Invariance Test (INIT). INIT extends common model comparison practices in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to idiographic network structures to test for (in)equality between idiographic network structures. In a simulation study, we evaluated the performance of INIT on both saturated and pruned idiographic network structures by inspecting the rejection rate of the χ2 difference test and of model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC. Results show INIT performs adequately when 100 or more data points are available per individual. When applying INIT on saturated networks, AIC performed best as a model selection criteria, while BIC showed better results when applying INIT on pruned networks. In an empirical example, we highlight the possibilities of this new technique, illustrating how INIT provides researchers with a means of testing for (in)equality between idiographic network structures, and within idiographic network structures over time. To conclude, recommendations for empirical researchers are provided.},

Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem, i.e., computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However, the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification, i.e., learning the model. To address this challenge, we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states, which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system.},

Bayesian thinking underlies many parts of the implementation in the popular R package mgcv as well as in GAM theory more generally. This article aims to highlight useful links (and diﬀerences) between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to smoothing, and their practical applications in ecology (with an mgcvcentric viewpoint).

Too often, however, effective BCIs based on machine learning techniques may function as “black boxes” that are difﬁcult to analyze or interpret. In an effort toward more interpretable BCIs, we studied a family of N-back working memory tasks using a machine learning model, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which was both powerful and amenable to analysis. Participants performed the N-back task with three stimulus variants, auditoryverbal, visual-spatial, and visual-numeric, each at three working memory loads. GPR models were trained and tested on EEG data from all three task variants combined, in an effort to identify a model that could be predictive of mental workload demand regardless of stimulus modality. To provide a comparison for GPR performance, a model was additionally trained using multiple linear regression (MLR). The GPR model was effective when trained on individual participant EEG data, resulting in an average standardized mean squared error (sMSE) between true and predicted N-back levels of 0.44. In comparison, the MLR model using the same data resulted in an average sMSE of 0.55. We additionally demonstrate how GPR can be used to identify which EEG features are relevant for prediction of cognitive workload in an individual participant. A fraction of EEG features accounted for the majority of the model’s predictive power; using only the top 25\% of features performed nearly as well as using 100\% of features. Subsets of features identiﬁed by linear models (ANOVA) were not as efﬁcient as subsets identiﬁed by GPR. This raises the possibility of BCIs that require fewer model features while capturing all of the information needed to achieve high predictive accuracy.},

However, the validity of the adopted mean function and hyperparameters, and the dependence of the results on the choice have not been well explored. In this paper, we study the eﬀects of the underlying mean function and the hyperparameter selection on the reconstruction of the distance moduli from type Ia supernovae. We show that the choice of an arbitrary mean function aﬀects the reconstruction: a zero mean function leads to unphysical distance moduli and the best-ﬁt ΛCDM to biased reconstructions. We propose to marginalize over a family of mean functions and over the hyperparameters to eﬀectively remove their impact on the reconstructions. We further explore the validity and consistency of the results considering diﬀerent kernel functions and show that our method is unbiased.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the future capacity and remaining useful life of batteries is necessary to ensure reliable system operation and to minimise maintenance costs. The complex nature of battery degradation has meant that mechanistic modelling of capacity fade has thus far remained intractable; however, with the advent of cloud-connected devices, data from cells in various applications is becoming increasingly available, and the feasibility of data-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose Gaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and highlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic approaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian nonparametric method, and hence can model complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior information can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean functions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation model is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit correlations between data from different cells. We demonstrate the predictive capability of GPs for short-term and long-term (remaining useful life) forecasting on a selection of capacity vs. cycle datasets from lithium-ion cells.},

The framework encompasses many existing as well as new models. It includes regression for ‘generalized’ functional data, mean regression, quantile regression as well as generalized additive models for location, shape and scale (GAMLSS) for functional data. It admits many flexible linear, smooth or interaction terms of scalar and functional covariates as well as (functional) random effects and allows flexible choices of bases—particularly splines and functional principal components—and corresponding penalties for each term. It covers functional data observed on common (dense) or curve-specific (sparse) grids. Penalized-likelihood-based and gradient-boosting-based inference for these models are implemented in R packages refund and FDboost , respectively. We also discuss identifiability and computational complexity for the functional regression models covered. A running example on a longitudinal multiple sclerosis imaging study serves to illustrate the flexibility and utility of the proposed model class.

A key feature of the method proposed is that it allows us to make systematic inference on all model components within a unified parametric mixed model framework and can be easily implemented by fitting a working generalized linear mixed model by using existing statistical software.

              A general method for constructing low‐rank tensor product smooths for use as components of generalized additive models or generalized additive mixed models is presented. A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these “marginal” smooths being represented using a low‐rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no “natural” way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single‐penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},

	abstract = {Intensive longitudinal data provide psychological researchers with the potential to better understand individual-level temporal processes. While the collection of such data has become increasingly common, there are a comparatively small number of methods well-suited for analyzing these data, and many methods assume homogeneity across individuals. A recent development rooted in structural equation and vector autoregressive modeling, Subgrouping Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (S-GIMME), provides one method for arriving at individual-level models composed of processes shared by the sample, a subset of the sample, and a given individual. As this algorithm was motivated and validated for use with neuroimaging data, its performance is less understood in the context of ambulatory assessment data. Here, we evaluate the performance of the S-GIMME algorithm across various conditions frequently encountered with daily diary (compared to neuroimaging) data; namely, a smaller number of variables, a lower number of time points, and smaller autoregressive effects. We demonstrate, for the first time, the importance of the autoregressive effects in recovering data-generating connections and directions, and the ability to use S-GIMME with lengths of data commonly seen in daily diary studies. We demonstrate the use of S-GIMME with an empirical example evaluating the general, shared, and unique temporal processes associated with a sample of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Finally, we underscore the need for methods such as S-GIMME moving forward given the increasing use of intensive longitudinal data in psychological research, and the potential for these data to provide novel insights into human behavior and mental health.},

Speciﬁcally, the NTS package covers the implementation of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, autoregressive conditional mean models with exogenous variables (ACMx), functional autoregressive models, and state-space models. Users can also evaluate and compare the performance of different models and select the best one for prediction. Furthermore, the package implements ﬂexible and comprehensive sequential Monte Carlo methods (also known as particle ﬁlters) for modeling non-Gaussian or nonlinear processes.

	abstract = {Often, in the analysis of time series and digital signals, a smoothing procedure is required to filter undesired random perturbations as noise and outliers in data. Among the most widely known techniques for time series smoothing, we have convolutional filters, simple exponential smoothing, triple exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters method) and linear adaptive filters, such as the Wiener filter. In this paper, we propose the NoLAW filter (Non-Linear Adaptive Wiener filter ), a higher-order nonlinear extension for the adaptive Wiener filter, which is a linear statistical smoothing technique that assumes the hypothesis that the underlying series is corrupted by a zero mean, additive and independent Gaussian noise. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is a computationally efficient and viable approach for filtering time series. Quantitative metrics show that the NoLAW filter is capable of producing better results than the usual linear Wiener filter, simple exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters method. Moreover, the computational cost of the proposed NoLAW is linear in the number of samples, which means that, asymptotically, it is equivalent to the regular Wiener filter.},

The Bayesian incarnation of the GPLVM [Titsias and Lawrence, 2010] uses a variational framework, where the posterior over latent variables is approximated by a well-behaved variational family, a factorised Gaussian yielding a tractable lower bound. However, the non-factorisability of the lower bound prevents truly scalable inference. In this work, we study the doubly stochastic formulation of the Bayesian GPLVM model amenable with minibatch training. We show how this framework is compatible with diﬀerent latent variable formulations and perform experiments to compare a suite of models. Further, we demonstrate how we can train in the presence of massively missing data and obtain high-ﬁdelity reconstructions.We demonstrate the model’s performance by benchmarking against the canonical sparse GPLVM for high dimensional data examples.},

The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

The models developed were motivated by applications in cognitive neuroscience, and two case studies are presented. First, we show how GALAMMs can jointly model the complex lifespan trajectories of episodic memory, working memory, and speed/executive function, measured by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), digit span tests, and Stroop tests, respectively. Next, we study the effect of socioeconomic status on brain structure, using data on education and income together with hippocampal volumes estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. By combining semiparametric estimation with latent variable modeling, GALAMMs allow a more realistic representation of how brain and cognition vary across the lifespan, while simultaneously estimating latent traits from measured items. Simulation experiments suggest that model estimates are accurate even with moderate sample sizes.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for identification of time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models based on local polynomial modeling (LPM) and applies it to investigate the dynamic spectral information of event-related electroencephalogram (EEG). The proposed method models the TVAR coefficients locally by polynomials and estimates those using least-squares estimation with a kernel having a certain bandwidth. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method is developed to obtain the optimal bandwidth, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). Simulation results show that the LPM-based TVAR identification method outperforms conventional methods for different scenarios. The advantages of the LPM method make it a useful high-resolution timefrequency analysis (TFA) technique for nonstationary biomedical signals like EEG. Experimental results show that the LPM method can reveal more meaningful time-frequency characteristics than wavelet transform.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from many neurons on individual experimental trials. Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories—Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)—which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.},

However, psychological researchers may be relatively unequipped to analyze such data, given its many characteristics and the general complexities involved in longitudinal modeling. The current paper introduces time series analysis to psychological research, an analytic domain that has been essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of variables across many diverse ﬁelds. First, the characteristics of time series data are discussed. Second, different time series modeling techniques are surveyed that can address various topics of interest to psychological researchers, including describing the pattern of change in a variable, modeling seasonal effects, assessing the immediate and long-term impact of a salient event, and forecasting future values. To illustrate these methods, an illustrative example based on online job search behavior is used throughout the paper, and a software tutorial in R for these analyses is provided in the Supplementary Materials.},

	abstract = {Determining trend and implementing detrending operations are important steps in data analysis. Yet there is no precise definition of “trend” nor any logical algorithm for extracting it. As a result, various ad hoc extrinsic methods have been used to determine trend and to facilitate a detrending operation. In this article, a simple and logical definition of trend is given for any nonlinear and nonstationary time series as an intrinsically determined monotonic function within a certain temporal span (most often that of the data span), or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within that temporal span. Being intrinsic, the method to derive the trend has to be adaptive. This definition of trend also presumes the existence of a natural time scale. All these requirements suggest the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method as the logical choice of algorithm for extracting various trends from a data set. Once the trend is determined, the corresponding detrending operation can be implemented. With this definition of trend, the variability of the data on various time scales also can be derived naturally. Climate data are used to illustrate the determination of the intrinsic trend and natural variability.},

This paper therefore discusses why cyclic models may be considered for analysing AA data on emotions, and describes how this approach can be applied to an empirical AA dataset. Results suggest that cyclic modelling may be a useful method for describing and accounting for (diurnal) cyclic patterns in AA data, but should be used with a number of considerations in mind.},

In the proposed model, temporal dependency and amplitude of fluctuations are both included as random effects. Parameter estimation is done with a multiple-step approach using maximum likelihood, or with a recommended one-step approach using a Bayesian method. The similarity and differences between the proposed method and some existing methods are discussed and investigated using diary study data from older adults. The results from empirical data analysis revealed that temporal dependency and amplitude of fluctuations have different predictability of health outcomes and thus should be modeled and considered separately.},

Thus, ESM provides a powerful way of moving beyond simple questions about who is “happy” and who is not, to more intricate questions about when and why people experience positive and negative feelings. Compared to retrospective reports of feelings, ESM is less inﬂuenced by memory biases. ESM also allows researchers to analyze the patterning and relationships of feelings as they unfold over time. Despite the strengths and promise of this method, there are also limitations. For example, the heavy demand placed on research participants means that the sample might be biased toward highly conscientious individuals, and repeatedly reporting one’s moods might itself inﬂuence feelings. How to analyze ESM data is discussed, including the issue of how to aggregate momentary feelings into global measures of the average subjective well-being of individuals.},

Language learning, on this view, is a process of experience-dependent shaping and selection of broadly deﬁned domain-general and domain-speciﬁc genetic predispositions. The central concept of development is (neuro)cognitive growth in terms of self-organization. Linguistic structure-building is synergetic and emergent insofar as the acquisition of a critical mass of elements on a local level (e.g., words) results in the emergence of novel qualities and units on a macroscopic level (e.g., syntax). We argue that language development does not take a linear path but comes in phases of intermittent turbulence, ﬂuctuation, and stability, along a ‘‘chaotic itinerary’’. We review qualitative, quantitative and computational applications of this concept in the lexical, morphological, and syntactic domain. We identify as the most signiﬁcant property of the dynamic approach the temporal nature of language learning. As a medium-term forecast we anticipate a further diversiﬁcation of the dynamic approach, an increase in more formal approaches, and a stronger interest in issues of embodiment and embeddedness.},

Consistent with the axiology of dynamic systems theory, the mutable nature of the complex linguistic system as well as the emphasis on intra-individual variability are underscored within the methodological considerations informing this study. As such, a process-oriented, non-linear time series analysis was carried out to address the following research questions: (a) In what ways do the constructs of complexity, accuracy, and fluency develop longitudinally in a single untutored learner of ESL across multiple language tasks?; (b) To what extent do the relationships between these constructs change over one academic year in an English-speaking context?; and (c) In what ways does the diachronic development of syntactic complexity exhibit the characteristics of self-similarity (i.e., fractality)? Data were collected from an individual untutored learner of English as a second language on a weekly basis from two disparate oral tasks (viz., dialogic conversation and monologic narrative) for the period of one academic year. The density of data collection—consistent with a complexity perspective—provided sufficient granularity for the developmental trajectories of nine subcomponents of complexity, accuracy, and fluency to be scrutinized in terms of their growth, regression, and, equally, the synergistic relationship among these constructs.

Results of the non-linear time analysis confirm several assumptions regarding the nature of language as a complex dynamic system. Findings illustrate the ways in which grammatical complexity, accuracy, and fluency develop uniquely across tasks. In addition, the complex relationships between these domains demonstrate the dynamism within the interconnectedness of the components of the complex linguistic system and, ultimately, how such relationships develop uniquely over time to support language development. In addition, results indicate that, typical of chaotic systems, language development demonstrates self-similarity (i.e., fractality) across temporal levels and equally passes through periods of bifurcation in which complexity, accuracy, and fluency interact uniquely to promote the transition between attractor states.},

	abstract = {Background: A defining characteristic of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is its episodic course, which might indicate that MDD is a nonlinear dynamic phenomenon with two discrete states. We investigated this hypothesis using the symptom time series of individual patients.
Methods: In 178 primary care patients with MDD, the presence of the nine DSM-IV symptoms of depression was recorded weekly for two years. For each patient, the time-series plots as well as the frequency distributions of the symptoms over 104 weeks were inspected. Furthermore, two indicators of bimodality were obtained: the bimodality coefficient (BC) and the fit of a 1- and a 2-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
Results: In 66 \% of the sample, high bimodality coefficients (BC {\textgreater} .55) were found. These corresponded to relatively sudden jumps in the symptom curves and to highly skewed or bimodal frequency distributions. The results of the HMM analyses classified 90 \% of the symptom distributions as bimodal.
Conclusions: A two-state pattern can be used to describe the course of depression symptoms in many patients. The BC seems useful in differentiating between subgroups of MDD patients based on their life course data.},

	abstract = {Significance
            As complex systems such as the climate or ecosystems approach a tipping point, their dynamics tend to become dominated by a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. Using time series of autorecorded mood, we show that indicators of slowing down are also predictive of future transitions in depression. Specifically, in persons who are more likely to have a future transition, mood dynamics are slower and different aspects of mood are more correlated. This supports the view that the mood system may have tipping points where reinforcing feedbacks among a web of symptoms can propagate a person into a disorder. Our findings suggest the possibility of early warning systems for psychiatric disorders, using smartphone-based mood monitoring.
          , 
            About 17\% of humanity goes through an episode of major depression at some point in their lifetime. Despite the enormous societal costs of this incapacitating disorder, it is largely unknown how the likelihood of falling into a depressive episode can be assessed. Here, we show for a large group of healthy individuals and patients that the probability of an upcoming shift between a depressed and a normal state is related to elevated temporal autocorrelation, variance, and correlation between emotions in fluctuations of autorecorded emotions. These are indicators of the general phenomenon of critical slowing down, which is expected to occur when a system approaches a tipping point. Our results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of elevated mood interspersed with episodes of depression. While treatment developments and understanding the disruptive nature of this illness have focused on these episodes, it is also evident that some patients may have chronic week-to-week mood instability. This is also a major morbidity. The longitudinal pattern of this mood instability is poorly understood as it has, until recently, been difficult to quantify. We propose that understanding this mood variability is critical for the development of cognitive neuroscience-based treatments. In this study, we develop a time-series approach to capture mood variability in two groups of patients with bipolar disorder who appear on the basis of clinical judgement to show relatively stable or unstable illness courses. Using weekly mood scores based on a self-rated scale (quick inventory of depressive symptomatology—self-rated; QIDS-SR) from 23 patients over a 220-week period, we show that the observed mood variability is nonlinear and that the stable and unstable patient groups are described by different nonlinear time-series processes. We emphasize the necessity in combining both appropriate measures of the underlying deterministic processes (the QIDS-SR score) and noise (uncharacterized temporal variation) in understanding dynamical patterns of mood variability associated with bipolar disorder.},

Employees’ perceptions of challenge and skill and their subjective experiences in terms of enjoyment, interest and absorption were measured using the experience sampling method, yielding a total of 6981 observations from a sample of 60 employees. Linear and nonlinear approaches were applied in order to model both continuous and sudden changes. According to the R2, AICc and BIC indexes, the nonlinear dynamical systems model (i.e. cusp catastrophe model) fit the data better than the linear and logistic regression models. Likewise, the cusp catastrophe model appears to be especially powerful for modelling those cases of high levels of flow. Overall, flow represents a nonequilibrium condition that combines continuous and abrupt changes across time. Research and intervention efforts concerned with this process should focus on the variable of challenge, which, according to our study, appears to play a key role in the abrupt changes observed in work-related flow.},

We discuss two models that take measurement error into account: An autoregressive model with a white noise term (AR+WN), and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. In a simulation study we compare the parameter recovery performance of these models, and compare this performance for both a Bayesian and frequentist approach. We ﬁnd that overall, the AR+WN model performs better. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that for realistic (i.e., small) sample sizes, psychological research would beneﬁt from a Bayesian approach in ﬁtting these models. Finally, we illustrate the effect of disregarding measurement error in an AR(1) model by means of an empirical application on mood data in women. We ﬁnd that, depending on the person, approximately 30–50\% of the total variance was due to measurement error, and that disregarding this measurement error results in a substantial underestimation of the autoregressive parameters.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Experience sampling methodology studies, in which participants complete questionnaires multiple times a day over an extended period, are increasingly popular in the social sciences in general and quality-of-life research in particular. The intensive longitudinal methods allow for studying the dynamics of constructs (e.g., how much patient-reported outcomes (PROs) vary across time). These methods promise higher ecological validity and lower recall bias than traditional methods that question participants only once, since the high frequency means that participants complete questionnaires in their everyday lives and do not have to retrospectively report about a large time interval. However, to ensure the validity of the results obtained from analyzing the intensive longitudinal data (ILD), greater awareness and understanding of appropriate measurement practices are needed.
Method: We surveyed 42 researchers experienced with ILD regarding their measurement practices and reasons for suboptimal practices.
Results: Results showed that researchers typically do not use measures validated specifically for ILD. Participants assessing the psychometric properties and invariance of measures in their current studies was even less common, as was accounting for these properties when analyzing dynamics. This was mainly because participants did not have the necessary knowledge to conduct these assessments or were unaware of their importance for drawing valid inferences. Open science practices, in contrast, appear reasonably well ingrained in ILD studies.
Conclusion: Measurement practices in ILD still need to be improved in some key areas, and we provide recommendations for this in order to create a solid foundation for measuring and analyzing psychological constructs.},

	abstract = {In linear regression problems with many predictors, penalized regression techniques are often used to guard against overfitting and to select variables relevant for predicting an outcome variable. Recently, Bayesian penalization is becoming increasingly popular in which the prior distribution performs a function similar to that of the penalty term in classical penalization. Specifically, the so-called shrinkage priors in Bayesian penalization aim to shrink small effects to zero while maintaining true large effects. Compared to classical penalization techniques, Bayesian penalization techniques perform similarly or sometimes even better, and they offer additional advantages such as readily available uncertainty estimates, automatic estimation of the penalty parameter, and more flexibility in terms of penalties that can be considered. However, many different shrinkage priors exist and the available, often quite technical, literature primarily focuses on presenting one shrinkage prior and often provides comparisons with only one or two other shrinkage priors. This can make it difficult for researchers to navigate through the many prior options and choose a shrinkage prior for the problem at hand. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on Bayesian penalization. We provide a theoretical and conceptual comparison of nine different shrinkage priors and parametrize the priors, if possible, in terms of scale mixture of normal distributions to facilitate comparisons. We illustrate different characteristics and behaviors of the shrinkage priors and compare their performance in terms of prediction and variable selection in a simulation study. Additionally, we provide two empirical examples to illustrate the application of Bayesian penalization. Finally, an R package bayesreg is available online (https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg) which allows researchers to perform Bayesian penalized regression with novel shrinkage priors in an easy manner.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses key results from the literature in the field of local polynomial regres sion. Local polynomial regression (LPR) is a nonparametric technique for smoothing scatter
plots and modeling functions. For each point, x0, a low-order polynomial WLS regression is
fit using only points in some “neighborhood” of x0. The result is a smooth function over the
support of the data. LPR has good performance on the boundary and is superior to all other
linear smoothers in a minimax sense. The quality of the estimated function is dependent on the
choice of weighting function, K, the size the neighborhood, h, and the order of polynomial fit,
p. We discuss each of these choices, paying particular attention to bandwidth selection. When
choosing h, “plug-in” methods tend to outperform cross-validation methods, but computa tional considerations make the latter a desirable choice. Variable bandwidths are more flexible
than global ones, but both can have good asymptotic and finite-sample properties. Odd-order
polynomial fits are superior to even fits asymptotically, and an adaptive order method that is
robust to bandwidth is discussed. While the Epanechnikov kernel is superior is an asymptotic
minimax sense, a variety are used in practice. Extensions to various types of data and other
applications of LPR are also discussed.},

The problem of objectively choosing the bandwidth of a kernel estimate forf is addressed. It is shown both theoretically and by simulation that crossvalidation produces extremely rough kernel estimates when the data are sufficiently positively correlated. This makes it inadvisable to use residuals from a cross-validated kernel estimate as a means of estimating the covariance function of the errors. Alternative methods of estimating the covariance function are proposed. In a simulation study, incorporating these estimated covariances into a risk estimation procedure leads to more efficient smoothing of positively correlated data.},

	abstract = {Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. These data allow one to estimate models of within-subject dynamics, and thereby avoid the notorious problem of making within-subjects inferences from between-subjects data, and naturally address heterogeneity between subjects. A popular model for these data is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, in which each variable is predicted by a linear function of all variables at previous time points. A key assumption of this model is that its parameters are constant (or stationary) across time. However, in many areas of psychological research time-varying parameters are plausible or even the subject of study. In this tutorial paper, we introduce methods to estimate time-varying VAR models based on splines and kernel-smoothing with/without regularization. We use simulations to evaluate the relative performance of all methods in scenarios typical in applied research, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial showing how to apply the discussed methods to an openly available time series of mood-related measurements.},

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efﬁcient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efﬁciency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

A major difficulty lies in the evaluation of the cross-validation function that requires the calculation of the trace of an inverse matrix. In the last few years stochastic trace estimators have been proposed to alleviate this problem. This article demonstrates numerical approximation techniques that further reduce the computational complexity. The new approach employs Gauss quadrature to compute lower and upper bounds on the cross-validation function. It only requires the operator form of the system matrix--that is, a subroutine to evaluate matrix-vector products. Thus, the factorization of large matrices can be avoided. The new approach has been implemented in MATLAB. Numerical experiments confirm the remarkable accuracy of the stochastic trace estimator. Regularization parameters are computed for ill-posed problems with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 unknowns.},

	abstract = {Autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) models combine features of latent growth curve models and autoregressive models into a single modeling framework. The development of ALT models has focused primarily on models with linear growth components, but some social processes follow nonlinear trajectories. Although it is straightforward to extend ALT models to allow for some forms of nonlinear trajectories, the identification status of such models, approaches to comparing them with alternative models, and the interpretation of parameters have not been systematically assessed. In this paper we focus on two forms of nonlinear autoregressive latent trajectory (NLALT) models. The first form allows for a quadratic growth trajectory, a popular form of nonlinear latent growth curve models. The second form derives from latent basis models, or freed loading models, that allow for arbitrary growth processes. We discuss details concerning parameterization, model identification, estimation, and testing for the two forms of NLALT models. We include a simulation study that illustrates potential biases that may arise from fitting alternative models to data derived from an autoregressive process and individual-specific nonlinear trajectories. In addition, we include an extended empirical example modeling growth trajectories of weight from birth through age 2.},

We argue that the autoregressive and trajectory models are special cases of a more encompassing model that we call the autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) model. In this paper we detail the underlying statistical theory and mathematical identification of this model, and demonstrate the ALT model using two empirical data sets. The first reanalyzes a simulated repeated measures data set that was previously used to argue against the autoregressive model, and we illustrate how the ALT model can recover the true latent curve model. Second, we apply the ALT model to real family income data on N=3912 adults over a seven year period and find evidence for both autoregressive and latent trajectory processes.

The threshold value has an interesting interpretation. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate that this new class of models exhibits some well‐known features of non‐linear vibrations.

	abstract = {Generalized cross validation (GCV) is one of the most important approaches used to estimate parameters in the context of inverse problems and regularization techniques. A notable example is the determination of the smoothness parameter in splines. When the data are generated by a state space model, like in the spline case, efficient algorithms are available to evaluate the GCV score with complexity that scales linearly in the data set size. However, these methods are not amenable to on-line applications since they rely on forward and backward recursions. Hence, if the objective has been evaluated at time \$t-1\$ and new data arrive at time t, then O(t) operations are needed to update the GCV score. In this paper we instead show that the update cost is \$O(1)\$, thus paving the way to the on-line use of GCV. This result is obtained by deriving the novel GCV filter which extends the classical Kalman filter equations to efficiently propagate the GCV score over time. We also illustrate applications of the new filter in the context of state estimation and on-line regularized linear system identification.},

Here, we provide a primer on longitudinal models, written in a beginner-friendly (and slightly irreverent) manner, with a particular focus on selecting among different modeling frameworks (e.g., multilevel versus latent curve models) to build the theoretical model of development a researcher wishes to test. Our aims are three-fold: 1) lay out a heuristic framework for longitudinal model selection, 2) build a repository of references that ground each model in its tradition of methodological development and practical implementation with a focus on connecting researchers to resources outside traditional neuroimaging journals, and 3) provide practical resources in the form of a codebook companion demonstrating how to fit these models. These resources together aim to enhance training for the next generation of developmental neuroscientists by providing a solid foundation for future forays into advanced modeling applications.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

We present simulation evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal 'across-the-function' frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identifiability constraints.},

            Gaussian processes are powerful non-parametric probabilistic models for stochastic functions. However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

	abstract = {Importance weighting is a general way to adjust Monte Carlo integration to account for draws from the wrong distribution, but the resulting estimate can be highly variable when the importance ratios have a heavy right tail. This routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution that are not well captured by the approximating distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates, and convergence diagnostics. The presented Pareto \${\textbackslash}hat\{k\}\$ finite sample convergence rate diagnostic is useful for any Monte Carlo estimator.},

This model identiﬁes subgroups of individuals with similar traits and dynamic processes, while also allowing for between-individual differences in these attributes within the different subgroups. We illustrate the model in an application to emotion dynamics data. The sample consists of individuals from two different age groups. Using our mixture multilevel vector-autoregressive model, we describe the between-individual differences that are present in the emotion dynamics of this sample. We do so by describing the more homogeneous subgroups that were identiﬁed by our model, and by describing the between-individual differences within the different subgroups.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent dynamics is ubiquitous in the natural world and beyond. Eﬀectively analysing its presence in data is essential to our ability to understand the systems from which it is recorded. However, the traditional framework for dynamics analysis is in terms of time-independent dynamical systems and long-term statistics, as opposed to the explicit tracking over time of time-localised dynamical behaviour. We review commonly used analysis techniques based on this traditional statistical framework—such as the autocorrelation function, power-spectral density, and multiscale sample entropy—and contrast to an alternative framework in terms of ﬁnite-time dynamics of networks of time-dependent cyclic processes. In time-independent systems, the net eﬀect of a large number of individually intractable contributions may be considered as noise; we show that time-dependent oscillator systems with only a small number of contributions may appear noise-like when analysed according to the traditional framework using powerspectral density estimation. However, methods characteristic of the time-dependent ﬁnite-time-dynamics framework, such as the wavelet transform and wavelet bispectrum, are able to identify the determinism and provide crucial information about the analysed system. Finally, we compare these two frameworks for three sets of experimental data. We demonstrate that while techniques based on the traditional framework are unable to reliably detect and understand underlying time-dependent dynamics, the alternative framework identiﬁes deterministic oscillations and interactions.},

A less often quoted contribution of Kalman’s to the control theory literature is that of the concepts of controllability and observability which may be used to analyse the state transition and observation equations and give insights into the ﬁlter’s viability. This paper aims to highlight the usefulness of these two ideas during the design stage of the ﬁlter and, as well as presenting the standard solutions for linear systems, uses a practical vision application (that of tracking plants for an autonomous crop protection vehicle) to illustrate a useful special case where these methods may be applied to a non-linear system. The application of tests for controllability and observability to the practical non-linear system give not only conﬁrmation that the ﬁlter will be able to produce stable estimates, but also gives a lower bound on the number of features required from each image for it to do so.},

              Background
              A growing body of research highlights the limitations of traditional methods for studying the process of change in psychotherapy. The science of complex systems offers a useful paradigm for studying patterns of psychopathology and the development of more functional patterns in psychotherapy. Some basic principles of change are presented from subdisciplines of complexity science that are particularly relevant to psychotherapy: dynamical systems theory, synergetics, and network theory. Two early warning signs of system transition that have been identified across sciences (critical fluctuations and critical slowing) are also described. The network destabilization and transition (NDT) model of therapeutic change is presented as a conceptual framework to import these principles to psychotherapy research and to suggest future research directions.
            
            
              Discussion
              A complex systems approach has a number of implications for psychotherapy research. We describe important design considerations, targets for research, and analytic tools that can be used to conduct this type of research.
            
            
              Conclusions
              A complex systems approach to psychotherapy research is both viable and necessary to more fully capture the dynamics of human change processes. Research to date suggests that the process of change in psychotherapy can be nonlinear and that periods of increased variability and critical slowing might be early warning signals of transition in psychotherapy, as they are in other systems in nature. Psychotherapy research has been limited by small samples and infrequent assessment, but ambulatory and electronic methods now allow researchers to more fully realize the potential of concepts and methods from complexity science.},

              Objective
              Symptom counts as the basis for Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnoses in the DSM presume each symptom is equally reflective of underlying disorder severity. However, the “equal weight” assumption fails to fit PTSD symptom data when tested. The present study developed an enhanced PTSD diagnosis based on (a) a conventional PTSD diagnosis from a clinical interview and (b) an empirical classification of full PTSD that reflected the relative clinical weights of each symptom.
            
            
              Method
              
                Baseline structured interview data from Project Harmony (
                N
                 = 2658) was used. An enhanced diagnosis for full PTSD was estimated using an empirical threshold from moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) latent PTSD scale scores, in combination with a full conventional PTSD diagnosis based on interview data.
              
            
            
              Results
              One in 4 patients in the sample had a PTSD diagnosis that was inconsistent with their empirical PTSD grouping, such that the enhanced diagnostic standard reduced the diagnostic discrepancy rate by 20\%. Veterans, and in particular female Veterans, were at greatest odds for discrepancy between their underlying PTSD severity and DSM diagnosis.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Psychometric methodologies that differentially weight symptoms can complement DSM criteria and may serve as a platform for symptom prioritization for diagnoses in future editions of DSM.},

	abstract = {Ecological Momentary Assessments (i.e., EMA, repeated assessments in daily life) are widespread in many fields of psychology and related disciplines. Yet, little knowledge exists on how differences in study designs and samples predict study compliance and dropout—two central parameters of data quality in (micro-)longitudinal research. The current meta-analysis included k = 477 articles (496 samples, total N = 677,536). For each article, we coded the design, sample characteristics, compliance, and dropout rate. The results showed that on average EMA studies scheduled six assessments per day, lasted for 7 days, and obtained a compliance of 79\%. Studies with more assessments per day scheduled fewer assessment days, yet, the number of assessments did not predict compliance or dropout rates. Compliance was significantly higher in studies providing financial incentives. Otherwise, design or sample characteristics had little effects. We discuss the implications of the findings for planning, reporting, and reviewing EMA studies.},
