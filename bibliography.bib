	abstract = {Scientific publication is immensely important to the scientific endeavour. There is, however, concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive, allowing careless and fraudulent conduct to thrive, compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel, positive findings rather than investigations confirming null hypothesis. This potentially compounds a reproducibility crisis in several fields, and risks undermining science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little modelling on factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. We present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists, with funding allocated by published outputs. This analysis suggests that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is influenced by false positive rate, and pressures for positive results. We find decreasing available funding has negative consequences for resulting trustworthiness, and examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science.},

	abstract = {Readers of peer-reviewed research may assume that the reported statistical analyses supporting scientific claims have been closely scrutinized and surpass a high-quality threshold. However, widespread misunderstanding and misuse of statistical concepts and methods suggests that suboptimal or erroneous statistical practice is routinely overlooked during peer review in psychology. Here, we explore whether psychology journals could ameliorate some of the field’s statistical ailments by adopting specialized statistical review: a focused technical assessment, performed by statistical experts, that addresses the analysis and presentation of quantitative information and supplements regular peer review. We discuss evidence from a recent survey of journal editors suggesting that specialized statistical review may be unusual in psychology journals and is regarded by many editors as unnecessary. We contrast these views with those in the biomedical domain, where statistical review has been considered a partial preventive measure against the improper use of statistics since the late 1970s. We suggest that the current “credibility revolution” presents an opportune occasion for psychology journals to consider adopting specialized statistical review.},

	abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (‘analytic reproducibility’). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal
              Cognition
              . Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect – imagined contact reducing prejudice – showed weak support for replicability. And two effects – flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification – did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.},

	abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance ( p {\textless} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion ( p {\textless} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen’s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({\textless} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

One topic receiving substantial attention is the role of replication in psychological science. Using the complete publication history of the 100 psychology journals with the highest 5-year impact factors, the current article provides an overview of replications in psychological research since 1900. This investigation revealed that roughly 1.6\% of all psychology publications used the term replication in text. A more thorough analysis of 500 randomly selected articles revealed that only 68\% of articles using the term replication were actual replications, resulting in an overall replication rate of 1.07\%. Contrary to previous findings in other fields, this study found that the majority of replications in psychology journals reported similar findings to their original studies (i.e., they were successful replications). However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. Moreover, despite numerous systemic biases, the rate at which replications are being published has increased in recent decades.},

Many findings in psychological science are based on studies with insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel research questions or replicate prior research in large, diverse samples. The PSA’s mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we describe the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time limited), efficient (in that structures and principles are reused for different projects), decentralized, diverse (in both subjects and researchers), and inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from anyone inside or outside the network). The PSA and other approaches to crowdsourced psychological science will advance understanding of mental processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and systematic examination of its generalizability.},

	abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

	abstract = {An academic scientist’s professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive—getting it right—competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive—getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

	abstract = {Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 ( Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

	abstract = {When consumers of science (readers and reviewers) lack relevant details about the study design, data, and analyses, they cannot adequately evaluate the strength of a scientific study. Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encouraging authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars – they cannot reliably tell the difference between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon – quality uncertainty – has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals’ reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts. The public expects transparency from science, and appropriately so – we should be held to a higher standard than used car salespeople.},

Meta-research has evaluated the merits of some individual initiatives; however, this may not capture broader trends reflecting the cumulative contribution of these efforts. In this study, we manually examined a random sample of 250 articles in order to estimate the prevalence of a range of transparency and reproducibility-related indicators in the social sciences literature published between 2014 and 2017. Few articles indicated availability of materials (16/151, 11\% [95\% confidence interval, 7\% to 16\%]), protocols (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]), raw data (11/156, 7\% [2\% to 13\%]) or analysis scripts (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]), and no studies were pre-registered (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]). Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 74/236, 31\% [25\% to 37\%]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (36/236, 15\% [11\% to 20\%]). Replication studies were rare (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Few studies were included in evidence synthesis via systematic review (17/151, 11\% [7\% to 16\%]) or meta-analysis (2/151, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Less than half the articles were publicly available (101/250, 40\% [34\% to 47\%]). Minimal adoption of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices could be undermining the credibility and efficiency of social science research.

In this article, the authors discuss a general methodology for testing catastrophe models and apply it to the dynamics of attitude formation and change. First, by making use of the so-called catastrophe flags, converging support for the catastrophe model can be attained. Each flag relates to a specific hypothesis about attitudinal change. Second, fitting stochastic catastrophe models to data enables one to carry out a direct test of catastrophe models. Results of analyzing large data sets on political attitudes support the validity of the general catastrophe model of attitude change in which transitions in attitudes are a function of involvement and information. Present results suggest that in the case of political attitudes, involvement might well be correlated with attitude. A more refined approach to the measurement of information and involvement is suggested.},

	abstract = {We address the question of equivalence between modeling results obtained on intra-individual and inter-individual levels of psychometric analysis. Our focus is on the concept of measurement invariance and the role it may play in this context. We discuss this in general against the background of the latent variable paradigm, complemented by an operational demonstration in terms of a linear state-space model, i.e., a time series model with latent variables. Implemented in a multiple-occasion and multiple-subject setting, the model simultaneously accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual differences. We consider the conditions—in terms of invariance constraints—under which modeling results are generalizable (a) over time within subjects, (b) over subjects within occasions, and (c) over time and subjects simultaneously thus implying an equivalence-relationship between both dimensions. Since we distinguish the measurement model from the structural model governing relations between the latent variables of interest, we decompose the invariance constraints into those that involve structural parameters and those that involve measurement parameters and relate to measurement invariance. Within the resulting taxonomy of models, we show that, under the condition of measurement invariance over time and subjects, there exists a form of structural equivalence between levels of analysis that is distinct from full structural equivalence, i.e., ergodicity. We demonstrate how measurement invariance between and within subjects can be tested in the context of high-frequency repeated measures in personality research. Finally, we relate problems of measurement variance to problems of non-ergodicity as currently discussed and approached in the literature.},

If theoretical predictions are weak we should not rely on all or nothing hypothesis tests. Different inferential methods may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published.

We show how the generalization of Bayesian inference to include replicated data yrep and replicated parameters θrep follows a long tradition of generalizations in Bayesian theory. On the theoretical level, we present a predictive Bayesian formulation of goodness-of-fit testing, distinguishing between p-values (posterior probabilities that specified antisymmetric discrepancy measures will exceed 0) and u-values (data summaries with uniform sampling distributions). We explain that p-values, unlike u-values, are Bayesian probability statements in that they condition on observed data. Having reviewed the general theoretical framework, we discuss the implications for statistical graphics and exploratory data analysis, with the goal being to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. We interpret various graphical displays as posterior predictive checks and discuss how Bayesian inference can be used to determine reference distributions. The goal of this work is not to downgrade descriptive statistics, or to suggest they be replaced by Bayesian modeling, but rather to suggest how exploratory data analysis fits into the probability-modeling paradigm. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for practical Bayesian inference. In particular, we anticipate that Bayesian software can be generalized to draw simulations of replicated data and parameters from their posterior predictive distribution, and these can in turn be used to calibrate EDA graphs.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Statistical methods to assess the impact of an intervention are increasingly used in clinical research settings. However, a comprehensive review of the methods geared toward practitioners is not yet available.

Methods and Materials
We provide a comprehensive review of three methods to assess the impact of an intervention: difference-in-differences (DID), segmented regression of interrupted time series (ITS), and interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). We also compare the methods, and provide illustration of their use through three important healthcare-related applications.

Results
In the first example, the DID estimate of the difference in health insurance coverage rates between expanded states and unexpanded states in the post-Medicaid expansion period compared to the pre-expansion period was 5.93 (95\% CI, 3.99 to 7.89) percentage points. In the second example, a comparative segmented regression of ITS analysis showed that the mean imaging order appropriateness score in the emergency department at a tertiary care hospital exceeded that of the inpatient setting with a level change difference of 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.73) and a trend change difference of 0.02 (95\% CI, 0.01 to 0.03) after the introduction of a clinical decision support tool. In the third example, the results from an interventional ARIMA analysis show that numbers of creatinine clearance tests decreased significantly within months of the start of eGFR reporting, with a magnitude of drop equal to −0.93 (95\% CI, −1.22 to −0.64) tests per 100,000 adults and a rate of drop equal to 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.95 to 0.99) tests per 100,000 per adults per month.

Discussion
When choosing the appropriate method to model the intervention effect, it is necessary to consider the structure of the data, the study design, availability of an appropriate comparison group, sample size requirements, whether other interventions occur during the study window, and patterns in the data.},

This assumes that all variables are measured without measurement error, which may be implausible. In addition, cross-sectional data cannot distinguish between within-subject and between-subject effects. This paper provides a general framework that extends GGM modeling with latent variables, including relationships over time. These relationships can be estimated from time-series data or panel data featuring at least three waves of measurement. The model takes the form of a graphical vector-autoregression model between latent variables and is termed the ts-lvgvar when estimated from time-series data and the panel-lvgvar when estimated from panel data. These methods have been implemented in the software package psychonetrics, which is exemplified in two empirical examples, one using time-series data and one using panel data, and evaluated in two large-scale simulation studies. The paper concludes with a discussion on ergodicity and generalizability. Although within-subject effects may in principle be separated from between-subject effects, the interpretation of these results rests on the intensity and the time interval of measurement and on the plausibility of the assumption of stationarity.},

In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means---the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

Beyond destabilizing the families, communities, or international regions in which they occur, they tend to perpetuate the very conditions of misery and hate that contributed to them in the first place. Although the common factors and processes associated with intractable conflicts have been identified through research, they represent an embarrassment of riches for theory construction. Thus, the current task in this area is integrating these diverse factors into an account that provides a coherent perspective yet allows for prediction and a basis for conflict resolution in specific conflict settings. We suggest that the perspective of dynamical systems provides such an account. This article outlines the key concepts and hypotheses associated with this approach. It is organized around a set of basic questions concerning intractable conflict for which the dynamical perspective offers fresh insight and testable propositions. The questions and answers are intended to provide readers with basic concepts and principles of complexity and dynamical systems that are useful for rethinking the nature of intractable conflict and the means by which such conflict can be transformed.},

With technological advances, intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are increasingly generated by studies of human behavior that repeatedly administer assessments over time. ILD offer unique opportunities to describe temporal behavioral changes in detail and identify related environmental and psychosocial antecedents and consequences. Traditional analytical approaches impose strong parametric assumptions about the nature of change in the relationship between time-varying covariates and outcomes of interest. This article introduces time-varying effect models (TVEMs) that explicitly model changes in the association between ILD covariates and ILD outcomes over time in a flexible manner. In this article, we describe unique research questions that the TVEM addresses, outline the model-estimation procedure, share a SAS macro for implementing the model, demonstrate model utility with a simulated example, and illustrate model applications in ILD collected as part of a smoking-cessation study to explore the relationship between smoking urges and self-efficacy during the course of the pre- and postcessation period.},

	abstract = {Summary
            I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d ≥ 1 dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

	abstract = {In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric TV-AR model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the TV-AR model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the TV-AR model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology.},

The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social science. This book brings together the most important breakthroughts in each of these fields and presents them in a unified fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Topics covered include the measurement of networks; methods for analysing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology; fundamentals of graph theory; computer algorithms, including spectral algorithms and community detection; mathematical models of networks such as random graph models and generative models; and models of processes taking place on networks.},

The positive manifold is often explained by positing a dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Across a wide range of studies, researchers often conclude that the home environment and children’s outcomes are causally linked. In contrast, behavioral genetic studies show that parents influence their children by providing them with both environment and genes, meaning the environment that parents provide should not be considered in the absence of genetic influences, because that can lead to erroneous conclusions on causation. This article seeks to provide behavioral scientists with a synopsis of numerous methods to estimate the direct effect of the environment, controlling for the potential of genetic confounding. Ideally, using genetically sensitive designs can fully disentangle this genetic confound, but these require specialized samples. In the near future, researchers will likely have access to measured DNA variants (summarized in a polygenic scores), which could serve as a partial genetic control, but that is currently not an option that is ideal or widely available. We also propose a work around for when genetically sensitive data are not readily available: the Familial Control Method. In this method, one measures the same trait in the parents as the child, and the parents’ trait is then used as a covariate (e.g., a genetic proxy). When these options are all not possible, we plead with our colleagues to clearly mention genetic confound as a limitation, and to be cautious with any environmental causal statements which could lead to unnecessary parent blaming.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a conceptual, empirical, and practical guide for estimating ordinal reliability coefficients for ordinal item response data (also referred to as Likert, Likert-type, ordered categorical, or rating scale item responses). Conventionally, reliability coefficients, such as Cronbachâ€™s alpha, are calculated using a Pearson correlation matrix. Ordinal reliability coefficients, such as ordinal alpha, use the polychoric correlation matrix (Zumbo, Gadermann, \& Zeisser, 2007). This paper presents (i) the theoretical-psychometric rationale for using an ordinal version of coefficient alpha for ordinal data; (ii) a summary of findings from a simulation study indicating that ordinal alpha more accurately estimates reliability than Cronbach's alpha when data come from items with few response options and/or show skewness; (iii) an empirical example from real data; and (iv) the procedure for calculating polychoric correlation matrices and ordinal alpha in the freely available software program R. We use ordinal alpha as a case study, but also provide the syntax for alternative reliability coefficients (such as beta or omega).

	abstract = {Objective
Recent developments in psychometrics enable the application of network models to analyze psychological disorders, such as PTSD. Instead of understanding symptoms as indicators of an underlying common cause, this approach suggests symptoms co-occur in syndromes due to causal interactions. The current study has two goals: (1) examine the network structure among the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and (2) incorporate clinically relevant variables to the network to investigate whether PTSD symptoms exhibit differential relationships with suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, physical functioning/quality of life (QoL), mental functioning/QoL, age, and sex.
Method
We utilized a nationally representative U.S. military veteran’s sample; and analyzed the data from a subsample of 221 veterans who reported clinically significant DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Networks were estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. Data and code are published along with the paper.
Results
The 20-item DSM-5 PTSD network revealed that symptoms were positively connected within the network. Especially strong connections emerged between nightmares and flashbacks; blame of self or others and negative trauma-related emotions, detachment and restricted affect; and hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related emotions, flashbacks, detachment, and physiological cue reactivity. Incorporation of clinically relevant covariates into the network revealed paths between self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation; concentration difficulties and anxiety, depression, and mental QoL; and depression and restricted affect.
Conclusion
These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and clinical outcomes in trauma survivors. Implications of these results for informing the assessment and treatment of this disorder, are discussed.},

We utilized data from a large psychiatric sample at admission and discharge from a partial hospital program (N = 1029, mean treatment duration = 8 days). We investigated features of the depression/anxiety network including topology, network centrality, stability of the network at admission and discharge as well as change in the network over the course of treatment. Results revealed that individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were more related to other symptoms within each disorder than to symptoms between disorders. Sad mood and worry were among the most central symptoms in the network. The network structure was stable both at admission and between admission and discharge, although the overall strength of symptom relationships increased as symptom severity decreased over the course of treatment. Examining depression and anxiety symptoms as dynamic systems may provide novel insights into the maintenance of these mental health problems.},

We analyzed whether EWSs (rising autocorrelations and standard deviations in emotions) preceded transitions toward psychopathology. Across indicators and a range of analytical options, EWSs had low sensitivity (M = 26\%, SD = 11\%) and moderate specificity (M = 75\%, SD = 14\%). Thus, in the present sample, the proposed generic nature and clinical utility of EWSs could not be substantiated.

	abstract = {The problem of statistical identification appears in different guises in many diverse fields. The most interesting form of the problem occurs when a sample of infinite size, assumed to be generated by one member of a class of statistical models indexed by a parameter, does not lead to certain knowledge of one or more elements of that parameter. A different type of identification problem arises when sample size is less than the number of elements of the parameter indexing the class of statistical models assumed to have generated the sample. For example, in the case of ordinary multiple regression, when sample size is less than the number of independent (explanatory) variables, it is not possible to estimate regression coefficients uniquely, even in the absence of collinearity among vectors of independent variable observations. This entry focuses on the former type of identification problem and takes a broad view of what is often considered a narrow problem particular to one's given field of interest. Following a brief history of statistical identification, the concept of ‘identifiability’ is examined and explained from both Bayesian and non-Bayesian viewpoints.},

Second, for partially identified models we demonstrate how to construct the prior and posterior distributions for the identified set parameter and how to conduct Bayesian analysis. Finally, for models that contain some parameters that are identified and others that are not we show that marginalizing out the identified parameter from the likelihood with respect to its conditional prior, given the nonidentified parameter, allows the data to be informative about the nonidentified and partially identified parameter.

It has been used as a theoretical model to conceptualize psychological concepts and as a statistical model to analyze psychological data. Using graphical models such as the Ising model to analyze psychological data has been heavily critiqued since these data often come from cross-sectional applications. An often voiced concern is the inability of the Ising model to express heterogeneity in the population. The idiographic approach has been posed as an alternative and aims to infer individual network structures. While idiographic networks overcome population heterogeneity, it is unclear how they aggregate into established cross-sectional phenomena. This paper establishes a formal bridge between idiographic and cross-sectional network approaches of the Ising model. We ascertain unique topological structures that characterize individuals and aggregate into an Ising model cross-sectionally. This new formulation supports population heterogeneity while being consistent with cross-sectional phenomena. The proposed theory also establishes a new statistical framework for analyzing populations of idiographic networks for binary variables. The Ising model and the divide and color model are special cases of this new framework. We introduce a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate models from this new framework.},

We show that our methods consistently select the correct structure and provide a new objective method to set the spike-and-slab hyperparameters. To circumvent the exploration of the complete structure space, which is too large in practical situations, we propose a novel approach that first screens for promising edges and then only explore the space instantiated by these edges.

	abstract = {Symptom fluctuations and the dynamic contexts provoking these are poorly understood. This deficit is compounded by people's limited ability to accurately report about such dimensions in retrospect. Utilizing the advantages of experience sampling methodology (ESM), this study rigorously describes and tests proximal environmental, neurobiological and psychological factors associated with symptoms and mood states. Participants were assigned to three diagnostic groups: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n = 118), Social Phobia (SP; n = 47), or a Control Group without SP or MDD (CG; n = 119). Laboratory assessments included cognitive abilities, memory, constructs, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). ESM lasted seven days, with six assessments per day covering symptoms, affect, daily events, social interactions, post-event processing, well-being, etc. Morning cortisol and actigraphy were also assessed during ESM. Thereafter, participants provided subjective retrospective recall estimates of the emotions they reported during ESM. The multi-level data of {\textgreater}10,000 observations will allow for thorough examination of fluctuations of psychopathology and well-being in two highly prevalent disorders. Using two clinical groups and a non-affected control group, the clinical specificity versus generalizability of processes can be directly tested, thus providing stimulating information about the overlap and differences between anxiety and affective disorders. This research informs about the development, fluctuation, and maintaining factors of emotions and symptoms and examines the accuracy with which participants recall these dimensions.},

Of the “at-risk” profile between 12.5\% and 25\% of the adolescents scored above the clinical cut-off for depression. These mood profiles predicted later depressive symptoms, while controlling for earlier symptoms. In subsample 1b, parents were not always aware of the mental health status of their adolescent.},

	abstract = {Background: Experience sampling, a method for real-time self-monitoring of affective experiences, holds opportunities for person-tailored treatment. By focussing on dynamic patterns of positive affect, experience sampling method interventions (ESM-I) accommodate strategies to enhance personalized treatment of depression--at potentially low-costs. This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of an experience sampling method intervention in patients with depression, from a societal perspective. Methods: Participants were recruited between January 2010 and February 2012 from out-patient mental health care facilities in or near the Dutch cities of Eindhoven and Maastricht, and through local advertisements. Out-patients diagnosed with major depression (n = 101) receiving pharmacotherapy were randomized into: (i) ESM-I consisting of six weeks of ESM combined with weekly feedback regarding the individual's positive affective experiences, (ii) six weeks of ESM without feedback, or (iii) treatment as usual only. Alongside this randomised controlled trial, an economic evaluation was conducted consisting of a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis, using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome, with willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY set at €50,000 (based on Dutch guidelines for moderate severe to severe illnesses). Results: The economic evaluation showed that ESM-I is an optimal strategy only when willingness to pay is around €3000 per unit HDRS and around €40,500 per QALY. ESM-I was the least favourable treatment when willingness to pay was lower than €30,000 per QALY. However, at the €50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, ESM-I was, with a 46\% probability, the most favourable treatment (base-case analysis). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. Conclusions: We may tentatively conclude that ESM-I is a cost-effective add-on intervention to pharmacotherapy in outpatients with major depression.},

Here we introduce the transfer entropy of the backward time series called the backward transfer entropy, and show that the backward transfer entropy quantifies how far it is from dynamics to a hidden Markov model. Furthermore, we discuss physical interpretations of the backward transfer entropy in completely different settings of thermodynamics for information processing and the gambling with side information. In both settings of thermodynamics and the gambling, the backward transfer entropy characterizes a possible loss of some benefit, where the conventional transfer entropy characterizes a possible benefit. Our result implies the deep connection between thermodynamics and the gambling in the presence of information flow, and that the backward transfer entropy would be useful as a novel measure of information flow in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, biochemical sciences, economics and statistics.},

This is based on the statistical prediction techniques developed by Crutchfield et al. and generates so called causal state models, equivalent in structure to hidden Markov models. The new method is applicable to any continuous data which clusters around discrete values and exhibits multiple transitions between these values such as tethered particle motion data or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) spectra. The algorithms developed have been shown to perform well on simulated data, demonstrating the ability to recover the model used to generate the data under high noise, sparse data conditions and the ability to infer the existence of degenerate states. They have also been applied to new experimental FRET data of Holliday Junction dynamics, extracting the expected two state model and providing values for the transition rates in good agreement with previous results and with results obtained using existing maximum likelihood based methods. The method differs markedly from previous Markov-model reconstructions in being able to uncover truly hidden states.},

	abstract = {We extend to the longitudinal setting a latent class approach that was recently introduced by Lanza, Coffman, and Xu to estimate the causal effect of a treatment. The proposed approach enables an evaluation of multiple treatment effects on subpopulations of individuals from a dynamic perspective, as it relies on a latent Markov (LM) model that is estimated taking into account propensity score weights based on individual pretreatment covariates. These weights are involved in the expression of the likelihood function of the LM model and allow us to balance the groups receiving different treatments. This likelihood function is maximized through a modified version of the traditional expectation-maximization algorithm, while standard errors for the parameter estimates are obtained by a nonparametric bootstrap method. We study in detail the asymptotic properties of the causal effect estimator based on the maximization of this likelihood function, and we illustrate its finite sample properties through a series of simulations showing that the estimator has the expected behavior. As an illustration, we consider an application aimed at assessing the relative effectiveness of certain degree programs on the basis of three ordinal response variables in which the work path of a graduate is considered as the manifestation of his or her human capital-level across time.},

This suggests that it is necessary to study how symptoms dynamically interact over time in a network architecture. In the present paper, we show how such an architecture can be constructed on the basis of time-series data obtained through Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM). The proposed methodology determines the parameters for the interaction between nodes in the network by estimating a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model on the data. The methodology allows combining between-subject and withinsubject information in a multilevel framework. The resulting network architecture can subsequently be analyzed through network analysis techniques. In the present study, we apply the method to a set of items that assess mood-related factors. We show that the analysis generates a plausible and replicable network architecture, the structure of which is related to variables such as neuroticism; that is, for subjects who score high on neuroticism, worrying plays a more central role in the network. Implications and extensions of the methodology are discussed.},

Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: What are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? And (3) how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models, and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

In this tutorial paper, we provide an accessible discussion of the interpretation of threshold and interaction parameters in the two domains and show how the dynamics of the Ising model depends on the choice of domain. Finally, we provide a transformation that allows one to transform the parameters in an Ising model in one domain into a statistically equivalent Ising model in the other domain.},

In the past century, various formal explanations have been proposed, including the dominant g factor, the revived sampling theory, and the recent multiplier effect model and mutualism model. In this article, we propose a novel idiographic explanation. We formally conceptualize intelligence as evolving networks in which new facts and procedures are wired together during development. The static model, an extension of the Fortuin?Kasteleyn model, provides a parsimonious explanation of the positive manifold and intelligence?s hierarchical factor structure. We show how it can explain the Matthew effect across developmental stages. Finally, we introduce a method for studying growth dynamics. Our truly idiographic approach offers a new view on a century-old construct and ultimately allows the fields of human ability and human learning to coalesce.},

	abstract = {Network analysis is quickly gaining popularity in psychopathology research as a method that aims to reveal causal relationships among individual symptoms. To date, four main types of psychopathology networks have been proposed: (1) association networks, (2) regularized concentration networks, (3) relative importance networks, and (4) directed acyclic graphs. We examined the replicability of these analyses based on symptoms of major depression and generalized anxiety between and within two highly similar epidemiological samples (i.e., the National Comorbidity Survey – Replication [n = 9282] and the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing [n = 8841]). While association networks were stable, the three other types of network analysis (i.e., the conditional independence networks) had poor replicability between and within methods and samples. The detailed aspects of the models—such as the estimation of specific edges and the centrality of individual nodes—were particularly unstable. For example, 44\% of the symptoms were estimated as the “most influential” on at least one centrality index across the six conditional independence networks in the full samples, and only 13–21\% of the edges were consistently estimated across these networks. One of the likely reasons for the instability of the networks is the predominance of measurement error in the assessment of individual symptoms. We discuss the implications of these findings for the growing field of psychopathology network research, and conclude that novel results originating from psychopathology networks should be held to higher standards of evidence before they are ready for dissemination or implementation in the field.},

The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientifically useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person's network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Mental disorders traditionally have been viewed as distinct, episodic, and categorical conditions. This view has been challenged by evidence that many disorders are sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exist on a continuum. Using the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, we examined the structure of psychopathology, taking into account dimensionality, persistence, co-occurrence, and sequential comorbidity of mental disorders across 20 years, from adolescence to midlife. Psychiatric disorders were initially explained by three higher-order factors (Internalizing, Externalizing, and Thought Disorder) but explained even better with one General Psychopathology dimension. We have called this dimension the p factor because it conceptually parallels a familiar dimension in psychological science: the g factor of general intelligence. Higher p scores are associated with more life impairment, greater familiality, worse developmental histories, and more compromised early-life brain function. The p factor explains why it is challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders. Transdiagnostic approaches may improve research.},

We do so by providing a commentary on his latest work, which he encouraged us to write, shortly before his death. We first discuss the statistical procedure McFarland used, which involved structural equation modeling (SEM) in standard SEM software. Next, we evaluate the penta-factor model of intelligence. We conclude that (1) standard SEM software is not suitable for the comparison of psychometric networks with latent variable models, and (2) the penta-factor model of intelligence is only of limited value, as it is nonidentified. We conclude with a reanalysis of the Wechlser Adult Intelligence Scale data McFarland discussed and illustrate how network and latent variable models can be compared using the recently developed R package Psychonetrics. Of substantive theoretical interest, the results support a network interpretation of general intelligence. A novel empirical finding is that networks of intelligence replicate over standardization samples.},

	abstract = {Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. These data allow one to estimate models of within-subject dynamics, and thereby avoid the notorious problem of making within-subjects inferences from between-subjects data, and naturally address heterogeneity between subjects. A popular model for these data is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, in which each variable is predicted by a linear function of all variables at previous time points. A key assumption of this model is that its parameters are constant (or stationary) across time. However, in many areas of psychological research time-varying parameters are plausible or even the subject of study. In this tutorial paper, we introduce methods to estimate time-varying VAR models based on splines and kernel-smoothing with/without regularization. We use simulations to evaluate the relative performance of all methods in scenarios typical in applied research, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial showing how to apply the discussed methods to an openly available time series of mood-related measurements.},

	abstract = {The class of random-cluster models is a uniﬁcation of a variety of stochastic processes of signiﬁcance for probability and statistical physics, including percolation, Ising, and Potts models; in addition, their study has impact on the theory of certain random combinatorial structures, and of electrical networks. Much (but not all) of the physical theory of Ising/Potts models is best implemented in the context of the random-cluster representation. This systematic summary of random-cluster models includes accounts of the fundamental methods and inequalities, the uniqueness and speciﬁcation of inﬁnite-volume measures, the existence and nature of the phase transition, and the structure of the subcritical and supercritical phases. The theory for two-dimensional lattices is better developed than for three and more dimensions. There is a rich collection of open problems, including some of substantial signiﬁcance for the general area of disordered systems, and these are highlighted when encountered. Amongst the major open questions, there is the problem of ascertaining the exact nature of the phase transition for general values of the cluster-weighting factor q, and the problem of proving that the critical random-cluster model in two dimensions, with 1 ≤ q ≤ 4, converges when re-scaled to a stochastic Lo¨wner evolution (SLE). Overall the emphasis is upon the random-cluster model for its own sake, rather than upon its applications to Ising and Potts systems.},

            Gifted children often display sensitivities to their environment that vary from those of the general population. Data were gathered on 6- to 11-year-old gifted children attending a public elementary school gifted program. Parents completed Dunn's (1999) Sensory Profile questionnaire regarding their child. Two primary analyses were conducted: (1) a comparison of the gifted children's sensory sensitivity with Sensory Profile norms and (2) an examination of the internal consistency of the Sensory Profile for the gifted sample. Gifted children were more sensitive to their environment and reacted with heightened emotional and behavioral responses than did children of average intelligence. Internal consistencies for the 14 Sensory Profile sections and the Sensory Profile factors for the gifted sample were found to be equal to the reported norms of the Sensory Profile. These findings further support that gifted children may have important sensory modulation differences and add to our understanding of gifted children.},

	abstract = {Spike synchronization underlies information processing and storage in the brain. But how can neurons synchronize in a noisy network? By exploiting a high-speed (500–2,000 fps) multineuron imaging technique and a large-scale synapse mapping method, we directly compared spontaneous activity patterns and anatomical connectivity in hippocampal CA3 networks ex vivo. As compared to unconnected pairs, synaptically coupled neurons shared more common presynaptic neurons, received more correlated excitatory synaptic inputs, and emitted synchronized spikes with approximately 10
              7
              times higher probability. Importantly, common presynaptic parents per se synchronized more than unshared upstream neurons. Consistent with this, dynamic-clamp stimulation revealed that common inputs alone could not account for the realistic degree of synchronization unless presynaptic spikes synchronized among common parents. On a macroscopic scale, network activity was coordinated by a power-law scaling of synchronization, which engaged varying sets of densely interwired (thus highly synchronized) neuron groups. Thus, locally coherent activity converges on specific cell assemblies, thereby yielding complex ensemble dynamics. These segmentally synchronized pulse packets may serve as information modules that flow in associatively parallel network channels.},

Simultaneous equations decompose the relationship between X and Y into an indirect component, operating through Z, and a direct component, the relationship between X and Y given Z. Often, X, Y, and/or Z are measured with error. Structural equation modeling is widely used in this scenario. However, sociological data commonly have a nested structure (students within schools, residents within local areas). Hierarchical linear models represent such multilevel data well and can handle errors of measurement, but have not incorporated simultaneous equations for direct and indirect effects. This article incorporates the study of such mediated effects into the hierarchical linear model, naturally extending the analysis to include unbalanced, multilevel designs and missing data. The authors illustrate the approach by examining the extent to which neighborhood social control mediates the relationship between neighborhood social composition and violence in Chicago.},

Within the context of biochemical reactions, we also propose a novel way of modeling interventions that modify the activity of compounds instead of their abundance. For computational reasons, we approximate the nonlinear causal mechanisms by (coupled) local linearizations, one for each experimental condition. We apply the method to reconstruct a cellular signaling network from the flow cytometry data measured by Sachs et al. (2005). We show that our method finds evidence in the data for feedback loops and that it gives a more accurate quantitative description of the data at comparable model complexity.},

Recursive structural equation models are one kind of DAG model. However, non-recursive structural equation models of the kinds used to model economic processes are naturally represented by directeed cyclic graphs (DCG). For linear systems associated with DCGs with independent errors, a characterisation of conditional independence constraints is obtained, and it is shown that the result generalizes in a natural way to systems in which the error variables or noises are statistically dependent. For non-linear systems with independent errors a sufficient condition for conditional independence of variables in associated distributions is obtained.},

Recent studies in neuroscience show that culturally contingent social processes shape some neural pathways. Studying the influence of cultural context on neural processes may yield new insights into psychiatric disorders. New methodologies in the neurosciences offer innovative ways to assess the impact of culture on mental health and illness. However, implementing these methodologies raises important theoretical and ethical concerns, which must be resolved to address patient individuality and the complexity of cultural diversity. This article discusses cultural context as a major influence on (and consequence of) human neural plasticity and advocates a culture–brain–behavior (CBB) interaction model for conceptualizing the relationship between culture, brain, and psychiatric disorders. Recommendations are made for integrating neuroscientific techniques into transcultural psychiatric research by taking a systems approach to evaluating disorders.},

            Phenotypic discordance between monozygotic twins, such as a difference in disease susceptibility, implicates the role of the environment in determining phenotype. To assess genomewide environmental effects on “gene expression phenotype,” we employed a published microarray data set for twins. We found that variations in expression phenotypes between monozygotic twins have biases in their chromosomal locations. They also showed a strong inverse correlation with gene density. Genomic regions of low gene density were environmentally sensitive, containing genes involved in response to external signals, cell differentiation, and development, etc. Genetic factors were found to make no contribution to the observed regional biases, stressing the role of epigenetics. We propose that epigenetic modifications might occur more frequently in heterochromatic, gene-poor regions in response to environmental signals while gene-rich regions tend to remain in an active chromatin configuration for the constitutive expression of underlying genes.},

When applying causal discovery algorithms designed for the acyclic setting on data generated by a system that involves feedback, one would not expect to obtain correct results. In this work, we show that---surprisingly---the output of the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm is correct if it is applied to observational data generated by a system that involves feedback. More specifically, we prove that for observational data generated by a simple and \$σ\$-faithful Structural Causal Model (SCM), FCI is sound and complete, and can be used to consistently estimate (i) the presence and absence of causal relations, (ii) the presence and absence of direct causal relations, (iii) the absence of confounders, and (iv) the absence of specific cycles in the causal graph of the SCM. We extend these results to constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that exploit certain forms of background knowledge, including the causally sufficient setting (e.g., the PC algorithm) and the Joint Causal Inference setting (e.g., the FCI-JCI algorithm).},

For this task, ancestral graph models are particularly useful in that they can represent the presence of latent confounding and selection effect, without explicitly invoking unobserved variables. Based on the machinery of ancestral graphs, there is a provably sound causal discovery algorithm, known as the FCI algorithm, that allows the possibility of latent confounders and selection bias. However, the orientation rules used in the algorithm are not complete. In this paper, we provide additional orientation rules, augmented by which the FCI algorithm is shown to be complete, in the sense that it can, under standard assumptions, discover all aspects of the causal structure that are uniquely determined by facts of probabilistic dependence and independence. The result is useful for developing any causal discovery and reasoning system based on ancestral graph models.},

In particular, acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs, form a well-studied subclass of SCMs that generalize causal Bayesian networks to allow for latent confounders. In this paper, we investigate SCMs in a more general setting, allowing for the presence of both latent confounders and cycles. We show that in the presence of cycles, many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs do not hold in general: they do not always have a solution; they do not always induce unique observational, interventional and counterfactual distributions; a marginalization does not always exist, and if it exists the marginal model does not always respect the latent projection; they do not always satisfy a Markov property; and their graphs are not always consistent with their causal semantics. We prove that for SCMs in general each of these properties does hold under certain solvability conditions. Our work generalizes results for SCMs with cycles that were only known for certain special cases so far. We introduce the class of simple SCMs that extends the class of acyclic SCMs to the cyclic setting, while preserving many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs. With this paper we aim to provide the foundations for a general theory of statistical causal modeling with SCMs.},

Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research (e.g., choosing a repository, preparing their research products for sharing, structuring folders, etc.). Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows.

Outlining a core set of best practices that can be applied across the sciences, Chambers demonstrates how all these sins can be corrected by embracing open science, an emerging philosophy that seeks to make research and its outcomes as transparent as possible.

	abstract = {According to the facial feedback hypothesis, people’s affective responses can be influenced by their own facial expression (e.g., smiling, pouting), even when their expression did not result from their emotional experiences. For example, Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) instructed participants to rate the funniness of cartoons using a pen that they held in their mouth. In line with the facial feedback hypothesis, when participants held the pen with their teeth (inducing a “smile”), they rated the cartoons as funnier than when they held the pen with their lips (inducing a “pout”). This seminal study of the facial feedback hypothesis has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 17 independent direct replications of Study 1 from Strack et al. (1988), all of which followed the same vetted protocol. A meta-analysis of these studies examined the difference in funniness ratings between the “smile” and “pout” conditions. The original Strack et al. (1988) study reported a rating difference of 0.82 units on a 10-point Likert scale. Our meta-analysis revealed a rating difference of 0.03 units with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from −0.11 to 0.16.},

	abstract = {The ability to self-correct is considered a hallmark of science. However, self-correction does not always happen to scientific evidence by default. The trajectory of scientific credibility can fluctuate over time, both for defined scientific fields and for science at-large. History suggests that major catastrophes in scientific credibility are unfortunately possible and the argument that “it is obvious that progress is made” is weak. Careful evaluation of the current status of credibility of various scientific fields is important in order to understand any credibility deficits and how one could obtain and establish more trustworthy results. Efficient and unbiased replication mechanisms are essential for maintaining high levels of scientific credibility. Depending on the types of results obtained in the discovery and replication phases, there are different paradigms of research: optimal, self-correcting, false nonreplication, and perpetuated fallacy. In the absence of replication efforts, one is left with unconfirmed (genuine) discoveries and unchallenged fallacies. In several fields of investigation, including many areas of psychological science, perpetuated and unchallenged fallacies may comprise the majority of the circulating evidence. I catalogue a number of impediments to self-correction that have been empirically studied in psychological science. Finally, I discuss some proposed solutions to promote sound replication practices enhancing the credibility of scientific results as well as some potential disadvantages of each of them. Any deviation from the principle that seeking the truth has priority over any other goals may be seriously damaging to the self-correcting functions of science.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to help think through the advantages and costs of rigorous pre-specification of statistical analysis plans in economics. A pre-analysis plan pre-specifies in a precise way the analysis to be run before examining the data. A researcher can specify variables, data cleaning procedures, regression specifications, and so on. If the regressions are pre-specified in advance and researchers are required to report all the results they pre-specify, data-mining problems are greatly reduced. I begin by laying out the basics of what a statistical analysis plan actually contains so those researchers unfamiliar with it can better understand how it is done. In so doing, I have drawn both on standards used in clinical trials, which are clearly specified by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as my own practical experience from writing these plans in economics contexts. I then lay out some of the advantages of pre-specified analysis plans, both for the scientific community as a whole and also for the researcher. I also explore some of the limitations and costs of such plans. I then review a few pieces of evidence that suggest that, in many contexts, the benefits of using pre-specified analysis plans may not be as high as one might have expected initially. For the most part, I will focus on the relatively narrow issue of pre-analysis for randomized controlled trials.},

In the strong version of this argument, preregistration does this by solving statistical problems, such as family-wise error rates. In the weak version, it nudges people to think more deeply about their theories, methods, and analyses. We argue against both: the diagnosticity of statistical tests depend entirely on how well statistical models map onto underlying theories, and so improving statistical techniques does little to improve theories when the mapping is weak. There is also little reason to expect that preregistration will spontaneously help researchers to develop better theories (and, hence, better methods and analyses).},

Regarding the PROI, I suggest that it could backfire if editors and authors feel coerced into data-sharing and so may not be the most pragmatic way of encouraging greater openness. More generally, while promoting data-sharing, we need to be sensitive to cases where sharing of data from human participants could create ethical problems. Furthermore, those interested in promoting reproducible science need to defend against an increased risk of data-dredging when large, multivariable datasets are shared.

However, after watching a video of a simulated bank robbery, participants who verbally described the robber were 25\% worse at identifying the robber in a lineup than were participants who instead listed U.S. states and capitals—this has been termed the “verbal overshadowing” effect (Schooler \& Engstler-Schooler, 1990). More recent studies suggested that this effect might be substantially smaller than first reported. Given uncertainty about the effect size, the influence of this finding in the memory literature, and its practical importance for police procedures, we conducted two collections of preregistered direct replications (RRR1 and RRR2) that differed only in the order of the description task and a filler task. In RRR1, when the description task immediately followed the robbery, participants who provided a description were 4\% less likely to select the robber than were those in the control condition. In RRR2, when the description was delayed by 20 min, they were 16\% less likely to select the robber. These findings reveal a robust verbal overshadowing effect that is strongly influenced by the relative timing of the tasks. The discussion considers further implications of these replications for our understanding of verbal overshadowing.},

	abstract = {Concerns have been raised recently about the replicability of behavioral priming effects, and calls have been issued to identify priming methodologies with effects that can be obtained in any context and with any population. I argue that such expectations are misguided and inconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as a computational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to be highly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subject populations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous or capricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absent theories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to such variation, failures to replicate another researcher’s findings will necessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can be made. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theories exist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time. Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide direct replications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient in meeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state of confusion. The recommendations issued in this article reflect concerns both with the practice of priming researchers and with the inappropriate expectations of researchers who have failed to replicate others’ priming effects.},

            Many philosophers of science and methodologists have argued that the ability to repeat studies and obtain similar results is an essential component of science. A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile results – most notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as well – cannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy, and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science.},

              Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology
              was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85\% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92\% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary – the replication was either a success or a failure – and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40\% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80\% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46\% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.},

It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate.

These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress—the most important shared goal of scientists—is likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one’s subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

            There is a broad agreement that psychology is facing a replication crisis. Even some seemingly well-established findings have failed to replicate. Numerous causes of the crisis have been identified, such as underpowered studies, publication bias, imprecise theories, and inadequate statistical procedures. The replication crisis is real, but it is less clear how it should be resolved. Here we examine potential solutions by modeling a scientific community under various different replication regimes. In one regime, all findings are replicated before publication to guard against subsequent replication failures. In an alternative regime, individual studies are published and are replicated after publication, but only if they attract the community’s interest. We find that the publication of potentially non-replicable studies minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency of knowledge gain for the scientific community under a variety of assumptions. Provided it is properly managed, our findings suggest that low replicability can support robust and efficient science.},

            The replicability of findings in experimental psychology can be improved by distinguishing sharply between hypothesis-generating research and hypothesis-testing research. This distinction can be achieved by preregistration, a method that has recently attracted widespread attention. Although preregistration is fair in the sense that it inoculates researchers against hindsight bias and confirmation bias, preregistration does not allow researchers to analyze the data flexibly without the analysis being demoted to exploratory. To alleviate this concern we discuss how researchers may conduct blinded analyses (MacCoun and Perlmutter in Nature 526:187–189, 2015). As with preregistration, blinded analyses break the feedback loop between the analysis plan and analysis outcome, thereby preventing cherry-picking and significance seeking.  However, blinded analyses retain the flexibility to account for unexpected peculiarities in the data.  We discuss different methods of blinding, offer recommendations for blinding of popular experimental designs, and introduce the design for an online blinding protocol.},

	abstract = {Preregistration is a method to increase research transparency by documenting research decisions on a public, third-party repository prior to any influence by data. It is becoming increasingly popular in all subfields of psychology and beyond. Adherence to the preregistration plan may not always be feasible and even is not necessarily desirable, but without disclosure of deviations, readers who do not carefully consult the preregistration plan might get the incorrect impression that the study was exactly conducted and reported as planned. In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in
              Psychological Science
              between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis. This closer look at preregistrations of the first generation reveals possible hurdles for reporting preregistered studies and provides input for future reporting guidelines. We discuss the results and possible explanations, and provide recommendations for preregistered research.},

	abstract = {We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the current outpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first idea is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5\%) puts reasonable bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature, making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication attempts are common—providing an even better test of the validity of a phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias, opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the field would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific practice.},

Meta-research may help calibrate the scientific ecosystem toward higher standards by providing empirical evidence that informs the iterative generation and refinement of reform initiatives. We introduce a translational framework that involves ( a) identifying problems, ( b) investigating problems, ( c) developing solutions, and ( d) evaluating solutions. In each of these areas, we review key meta-research endeavors and discuss several examples of prior and ongoing work. The scientific ecosystem is perpetually evolving; the discipline of meta-research presents an opportunity to use empirical evidence to guide its development and maximize its potential.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility has long been considered integral to the scientific method.  Something is called reproducible when an independent person obtains the same results from the same data.  Until recently, detailed descriptions of methods and analyses were the primary instrument for ensuring scientific reproducibility.  Technological advancements now enable scientists to achieve a more comprehensive standard;  one in which any individual can be granted access to a digital research repository, and reproduce the analyses from the raw data to the final report including all relevant statistical analyses with a single command.  This method has far-reaching implications for scientific archiving,  reproducibility and replication,  scientific productivity,  and the credibility and reliability of scientific findings.  One obstacle preventing the widespread adoption of this method is that the underlying technological advancements  are complicated to use.  This paper introduces `repro`, an R-package, which guides researchers in the installation and use of the tools required for making a research project reproducible.  Finally, we suggest the use of the proposed tools for the preregistration of study plans as reproducible computer code (preregistration as code; PAC).  Since computer code represents the planned analyses exactly as they will be executed, it is more precise than natural language descriptions of those analyses, which merely complement the PAC as a more readable summary.   PAC circumvents the shortcomings of ambiguous preregistrations that may give researchers undesired degrees of freedom.  Hence, reproducibility made convenient with automation has a wide range of applications to accelerate scientific progress.},

	abstract = {Numerous biases are believed to affect the scientific literature, but their actual prevalence across disciplines is unknown. To gain a comprehensive picture of the potential imprint of bias in science, we probed for the most commonly postulated bias-related patterns and risk factors, in a large random sample of meta-analyses taken from all disciplines. The magnitude of these biases varied widely across fields and was overall relatively small. However, we consistently observed a significant risk of small, early, and highly cited studies to overestimate effects and of studies not published in peer-reviewed journals to underestimate them. We also found at least partial confirmation of previous evidence suggesting that US studies and early studies might report more extreme effects, although these effects were smaller and more heterogeneously distributed across meta-analyses and disciplines. Authors publishing at high rates and receiving many citations were, overall, not at greater risk of bias. However, effect sizes were likely to be overestimated by early-career researchers, those working in small or long-distance collaborations, and those responsible for scientific misconduct, supporting hypotheses that connect bias to situational factors, lack of mutual control, and individual integrity. Some of these patterns and risk factors might have modestly increased in intensity over time, particularly in the social sciences. Our findings suggest that, besides one being routinely cautious that published small, highly-cited, and earlier studies may yield inflated results, the feasibility and costs of interventions to attenuate biases in the literature might need to be discussed on a discipline-specific and topic-specific basis.},

A major contributor of false positives is the practice of reporting a subset of the potentially relevant statistical analyses pertaining to a research project. This study is the first to provide direct evidence of selective underreporting in psychology experiments. To overcome the problem that the complete experimental design and full set of measured variables are not accessible for most published research, we identify a population of published psychology experiments from a competitive grant program for which questionnaires and data are made publicly available because of an institutional rule. We find that about 40\% of studies fail to fully report all experimental conditions and about 70\% of studies do not report all outcome variables included in the questionnaire. Reported effect sizes are about twice as large as unreported effect sizes and are about 3 times more likely to be statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Latent Change Score models (LCS) are a popular tool for the study of dynamics in longitudinal research. They represent processes in which the short-term dynamics have direct and indirect consequences on the long-term behavior of the system. However, this dual interpretation of the model parameters is usually overlooked in the literature, and researchers often ﬁnd it difﬁcult to see the connection between parameters and speciﬁc patterns of change. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of the meaning and interpretation of the parameters in LCS models. Importantly, we focus on their relation to the shape of the trajectories and explain how different speciﬁcations of the LCS model involve particular assumptions about the mechanisms of change. On a supplementary website, we present an interactive Shiny App that allows users to explore different sets of parameter values and examine their effects on the predicted trajectories. We also include fully explained code to estimate some of the most relevant speciﬁcations of the LCS model with the R-packages lavaan and OpenMx.},

To address reciprocal effects, a variety of longitudinal models that include cross-lagged relations have been proposed in different contexts and disciplines. However, the relations between these cross-lagged models have not been systematically discussed in the literature. This lack of insight makes it difficult for researchers to select an appropriate model when analyzing longitudinal data, and some researchers do not even think about alternative cross-lagged models. The present research provides a unified framework that clarifies the conceptual and mathematical similarities and differences between these models. The unified framework shows that existing longitudinal models can be effectively classified based on whether the model posits unique factors and/or dynamic residuals and what types of common factors are used to model changes. The latter is essential to understand how cross-lagged parameters are interpreted. We also present an example using empirical data to demonstrate that there is great risk of drawing different conclusions depending on the cross-lagged models used.},

This paper aims to present an approachable, non-technical overview of the state of the art on these challenges and the solutions that have been proposed, with emphasis on application towards psychosomatic hypotheses. Speciﬁcally, we elaborate on issues related to measurement intervals, the number and nature of the variables used in the analysis, modeling stable and changing processes, concurrent relationships, and extending time series analysis to incorporate the data of multiple individuals. We also brieﬂy discuss some general modeling issues, such as lag-speciﬁcation, sample size and time series length, and the role of measurement errors.

Along with the increased prevalence of ILD, more methods are being developed to analyze these data. However, relatively few methods have yet been applied for making long- or even short-term predictions from ILD in behavioral settings. Applications of forecasting methods to behavioral ILD are still scant. We first establish a general framework for modeling ILD and then extend that frame to two previously existing forecasting methods: these methods are Kalman prediction and ensemble prediction. After implementing Kalman and ensemble forecasts in free and open-source software, we apply these methods to daily drug and alcohol use data. In doing so, we create a simple, but nonlinear dynamical system model of daily drug and alcohol use and illustrate important differences between the forecasting methods. We further compare the Kalman and ensemble forecasting methods to several simpler forecasts of daily drug and alcohol use. Ensemble forecasts may be more appropriate than Kalman forecasts for nonlinear dynamical systems models, but further forecasting evaluation methods must be put into practice.},

The major difficulties are pointed out that arise when the data cannot be assumed to be purely deterministic and the potential that remains in this situation is discussed. For signals with weakly nonlinear structure, the presence of nonlinearity in a general sense has to be inferred statistically. The paper reviews the relevant methods and discusses the implications for deterministic modeling. Most field measurements yield nonstationary time series, which poses a severe problem for their analysis. Recent progress in the detection and understanding of nonstationarity is reported. If a clear signature of approximate determinism is found, the notions of phase space, attractors, invariant manifolds, etc., provide a convenient framework for time series analysis. Although the results have to be interpreted with great care, superior performance can be achieved for typical signal processing tasks. In particular, prediction and filtering of signals are discussed, as well as the classification of system states by means of time series recordings.},

Despite their relevance, many neuroscientists still apply linear estimates in order to evaluate complex interactions. This is partially due to the lack of a comprehensive compilation of non-linear methods. Available packages mostly specialize in only one aspect of non-linear time-series analysis and most often require some coding proficiency to use. Here, we introduce NoLiTiA, a free open-source MATLAB toolbox for non-linear time series analysis. In comparison to other currently available non-linear packages, NoLiTiA offers (1) an implementation of a broad range of classic and recently developed methods, (2) an implementation of newly proposed spatially and time-resolved recurrence amplitude analysis and (3) an intuitive environment accessible even to users with little coding experience due to a graphical user interface and batch-editor. The core methodology derives from three distinct fields of complex systems theory, including dynamical systems theory, recurrence quantification analysis and information theory. Besides established methodology including estimation of dynamic invariants like Lyapunov exponents and entropy-based measures, such as active information storage, we include recent developments of quantifying time-resolved aperiodic oscillations. In general, the toolbox will make non-linear methods accessible to the broad neuroscientific community engaged in time series processing.},

To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

Here, we aim to clarify the relationship between the within- and between-person distinction and causal inference, and show that the distinction is informative but does not play a decisive role in causal inference. Our main points are threefold. First, within-person data are not necessary for causal inference; for example, between-person experiments can inform us about (average) causal effects. Second, within-person data are not sufficient for causal inference; for example, time-varying confounders can lead to spurious within-person associations. Finally, despite not being sufficient, withinperson data can be tremendously helpful for causal inference. We provide pointers to help readers navigate the more technical literature on longitudinal models, and conclude with a call for more conceptual clarity: Instead of letting statistical models dictate which substantive questions we ask, we should start with well-defined theoretical estimands which in turn determine both study design and data analysis.},

On the other hand, purely mechanistic approaches  need to identify and specify all the interactions in the problem at hand (which  may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of how to parameterize the system. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes and differential equations to combine data driven modeling with a physical model of the system. We show how different, physically-inspired, kernel functions  can be developed through sensible, simple, mechanistic assumptions about the underlying system. The versatility of our approach is illustrated with three case studies from computational biology, motion capture and geostatistics.},

Existing time-series methods often have limitations, such as assuming linear interactions or having restricted forms, leading to difficulties in capturing the complex nature of these systems. To address this issue, we introduce fitlandr, a method with implementation as an R package that integrates nonparametric estimation of the drift-diffusion function and stability landscape. The drift-diffusion function is estimated using the Multivariate Kernel Estimator (MVKE, Bandi \& Moloche, 2018), and the stability landscape is estimated through Monte-Carlo estimation of the steady-state distribution (Cui et al., 2021, 2022). Using a simulated emotional system, we demonstrate that fitlandr can effectively recover bistable dynamics from data, even in the presence of moderate noise, and that it primarily relies on dynamic information from the system instead of distributional information. We then apply the method to two empirical single-participant ESM datasets and compared the results with the simulation datasets. Whereas both datasets show a bimodal distribution, fitlandr only revealed bistability in one of them, indicating that bimodality in ILD does not necessarily imply the existence of bistability in the underlying system. These results demonstrate the potential of fitlandr as a tool for uncovering the rich, nonlinear dynamics of psychological systems from ILD.},

To model these processes at the level of the individual, regime-switching models may prove useful. In this chapter we discuss two of these models: the threshold autoregressive model and the Markov switching autoregressive model. We discuss their main features, and propose estimation methods that can handle missing data. We apply these models to daily affect measurements of an individual diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar disorder.},

DSEM is suitable for analyzing intensive longitudinal data where observations from multiple individuals are collected at many points in time. The modeling framework encompasses previously published DSEM models and is a comprehensive attempt to combine time-series modeling with structural equation modeling. DSEM is estimated with Bayesian methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis–Hastings sampler. We provide a detailed description of the estimation algorithm as implemented in the Mplus software package. DSEM can be used for longitudinal analysis of any duration and with any number of observations across time. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the framework and study the performance of the estimation method. Methods for evaluating model fit are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Physically-inspired latent force models offer an interpretable alternative to purely data driven tools for inference in dynamical systems. They carry the structure of differential equations and the flexibility of Gaussian processes, yielding interpretable parameters and dynamics-imposed latent functions. However, the existing inference techniques associated with these models rely on the exact computation of posterior kernel terms which are seldom available in analytical form. Most applications relevant to practitioners, such as Hill equations or diffusion equations, are hence intractable. In this paper, we overcome these computational problems by proposing a variational solution to a general class of non-linear and parabolic partial differential equation latent force models. Further, we show that a neural operator approach can scale our model to thousands of instances, enabling fast, distributed computation. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our framework by achieving competitive performance on several tasks where the kernels are of varying degrees of tractability.},

	abstract = {The problem of combined state and input estimation of linear structural systems based on measured responses and a priori knowledge of structural model is considered. A novel methodology using Gaussian process latent force models is proposed to tackle the problem in a stochastic setting. Gaussian process latent force models (GPLFMs) are hybrid models that combine differential equations representing a physical system with data-driven non-parametric Gaussian process models. In this work, the unknown input forces acting on a structure are modelled as Gaussian processes with some chosen covariance functions which are combined with the mechanistic differential equation representing the structure to construct a GPLFM. The GPLFM is then conveniently formulated as an augmented stochastic state-space model with additional states representing the latent force components, and the joint input and state inference of the resulting model is implemented using Kalman ﬁlter. The augmented state-space model of GPLFM is shown as a generalization of the class of input-augmented state-space models, is proven observable, and is robust against drift in force estimation compared to conventional augmented formulations. The hyperparameters governing the covariance functions are estimated using maximum likelihood optimization based on the observed data, thus overcoming the need for manual tuning of the hyperparameters by trial-and-error. To assess the performance of the proposed GPLFM method, several cases of state and input estimation are demonstrated using numerical simulations on a 10-dof shear building and a 76-storey ASCE benchmark ofﬁce tower. Results obtained indicate the superior performance of the proposed approach over conventional Kalman ﬁlter based approaches.},

In contrast, the stochastic specification of the BLCS model includes parameters that capture the effect of such innovations at the latent level. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we generated two developmental processes and examined the recovery of the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic BLCS models under a broad range of empirically relevant conditions. Based on our findings, we provide specific guidelines and recommendations for the application of BLCS models in developmental research.},

	abstract = {State–space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture–recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. We present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

It provides an intuitive and direct interpretation of the dynamics of a stochastic process. Instead of principal component analysis commonly used in functional data analysis, we adopt a sieve estimation procedure based on B-spline approximation of the convolution functions. We establish convergence rate of the proposed estimator, and investigate its theoretical properties. The model building, model validation, and prediction procedures are also developed.

More recently, recurrence plots, initially proposed as a visual tool for the analysis of complex systems, have proven to be a powerful framework to quantify and reveal nontrivial dynamical features in time series data. This tutorial review provides a brief introduction to the fundamentals of nonlinear time series analysis, before discussing in greater detail a few (out of the many existing) approaches of recurrence plot-based analysis of time series. In particular, it focusses on recurrence plot-based measures which characterize dynamical features such as determinism, synchronization, and regime changes. The concept of surrogate-based hypothesis testing, which is crucial to drawing any inference from data analyses, is also discussed. Finally, the presented recurrence plot approaches are applied to two climatic indices related to the equatorial and North Paciﬁc regions, and their dynamical behavior and their interrelations are investigated.},

Many of the subject-specific biomedical systems can be described by a set of differential or difference equations which are similar to engineering dynamic systems. In this paper, motivated by HIV dynamic studies, we propose a class of mixed-effects state space models based on the longitudinal feature of dynamic systems. State space models with mixed-effects components are very flexible in modelling the serial correlation of within-subject observations and between-subject variations. The Bayesian approach and the maximum likelihood method for standard mixed-effects models and state space models are modified and investigated for estimating unknown parameters in the proposed models. In the Bayesian approach, full conditional distributions are derived and the Gibbs sampler is constructed to explore the posterior distributions. For the maximum likelihood method we develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with a Gibbs sampler step to approximate the conditional expectations in the E-step. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the two proposed methods. We apply the mixed-effects state space model to a data set from an AIDS clinical trial to illustrate the proposed methodologies. The proposed models and methods may also have potential applications in other biomedical system analyses such as tumor dynamics in cancer research and genetic regulatory network modeling.},

	title = {Mathematical and {Computational} {Modeling} of {Suicide} as a {Complex} {Dynamical} {System}},
	url = {https://osf.io/b29cs},
	abstract = {Background: Despite decades of research, the current suicide rate is nearly identical to what it was 100 years ago. This slow progress is due, at least in part, to a lack of formal theories of suicide. Existing suicide theories are instantiated verbally, omitting details required for precise explanation and prediction, rendering them difficult to effectively evaluate and difficult to improve. By contrast, formal theories are instantiated mathematically and computationally, allowing researchers to precisely deduce theory predictions, rigorously evaluate what the theory can and cannot explain, and thereby, inform how the theory can be improved. This paper takes the first step toward addressing the need for formal theories in suicide research by formalizing an initial, general theory of suicide and evaluating its ability to explain suicide-related phenomena.Methods: First, we formalized a General Escape Theory of Suicide as a system of stochastic and ordinary differential equations. Second, we used these equations to simulate behavior of the system over time. Third, we evaluated if the formal theory produced robust suicide-related phenomena including rapid onset and brief duration of suicidal thoughts, and zero-inflation of suicidal thinking in time series data.Results: Simulations successfully produced the proposed suicidal phenomena (i.e., rapid onset, short duration, and high zero-inflation of suicidal thoughts in time series data). Notably, these simulations also produced theorized phenomena following from the General Escape Theory of Suicide: that suicidal thoughts emerge when alternative escape behaviors failed to effectively regulate aversive internal states, and that effective use of long-term strategies may prevent the emergence of suicidal thoughts.  Conclusions: To our knowledge, the model developed here is the first formal theory of suicide, which was able to produce – and, thus, explain – well-established phenomena documented in the suicide literature. We discuss the next steps in a research program dedicated to studying suicide as a complex dynamical system, and describe how the integration of formal theories and empirical research may advance our understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicide.},

	abstract = {Psychological theories often invoke interactions but remain vague regarding the details. As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

	abstract = {The comparison of idiographic network structures in order to determine the presence of heterogeneity is a challenging endeavor in many applied settings. Previously, researchers eyeballed idiographic networks, computed correlations between idiographic networks, as well as used techniques that make use of the multilevel structure of the data (e.g., GIMME and mlVAR) to investigate individual differences. However, these methods do not allow for testing the equality of idiographic network structures directly. In this paper, we propose the Individual Network Invariance Test (INIT). INIT extends common model comparison practices in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to idiographic network structures to test for (in)equality between idiographic network structures. In a simulation study, we evaluated the performance of INIT on both saturated and pruned idiographic network structures by inspecting the rejection rate of the χ2 difference test and of model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC. Results show INIT performs adequately when 100 or more data points are available per individual. When applying INIT on saturated networks, AIC performed best as a model selection criteria, while BIC showed better results when applying INIT on pruned networks. In an empirical example, we highlight the possibilities of this new technique, illustrating how INIT provides researchers with a means of testing for (in)equality between idiographic network structures, and within idiographic network structures over time. To conclude, recommendations for empirical researchers are provided.},

Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem, i.e., computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However, the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification, i.e., learning the model. To address this challenge, we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states, which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system.},

GAMs are often considered to be a purely frequentist framework (‘generalized linear models with wiggly bits’), however links between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to these models were highlighted early on in the literature. Bayesian thinking underlies many parts of the implementation in the popular R package mgcv as well as in GAM theory more generally. This article aims to highlight useful links (and diﬀerences) between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to smoothing, and their practical applications in ecology (with an mgcvcentric viewpoint). Here I give some background for these results then move onto two important topics for quantitative ecologists: term/model selection and uncertainty estimation.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the passive monitoring of human cognitive state, including cognitive workload. Too often, however, effective BCIs based on machine learning techniques may function as “black boxes” that are difﬁcult to analyze or interpret. In an effort toward more interpretable BCIs, we studied a family of N-back working memory tasks using a machine learning model, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which was both powerful and amenable to analysis. Participants performed the N-back task with three stimulus variants, auditoryverbal, visual-spatial, and visual-numeric, each at three working memory loads. GPR models were trained and tested on EEG data from all three task variants combined, in an effort to identify a model that could be predictive of mental workload demand regardless of stimulus modality. To provide a comparison for GPR performance, a model was additionally trained using multiple linear regression (MLR). The GPR model was effective when trained on individual participant EEG data, resulting in an average standardized mean squared error (sMSE) between true and predicted N-back levels of 0.44. In comparison, the MLR model using the same data resulted in an average sMSE of 0.55. We additionally demonstrate how GPR can be used to identify which EEG features are relevant for prediction of cognitive workload in an individual participant. A fraction of EEG features accounted for the majority of the model’s predictive power; using only the top 25\% of features performed nearly as well as using 100\% of features. Subsets of features identiﬁed by linear models (ANOVA) were not as efﬁcient as subsets identiﬁed by GPR. This raises the possibility of BCIs that require fewer model features while capturing all of the information needed to achieve high predictive accuracy.},

The complex nature of battery degradation has meant that mechanistic modelling of capacity fade has thus far remained intractable; however, with the advent of cloud-connected devices, data from cells in various applications is becoming increasingly available, and the feasibility of data-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose Gaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and highlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic approaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian nonparametric method, and hence can model complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior information can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean functions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation model is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit correlations between data from different cells. We demonstrate the predictive capability of GPs for short-term and long-term (remaining useful life) forecasting on a selection of capacity vs. cycle datasets from lithium-ion cells.},

The framework encompasses many existing as well as new models. It includes regression for ‘generalized’ functional data, mean regression, quantile regression as well as generalized additive models for location, shape and scale (GAMLSS) for functional data. It admits many flexible linear, smooth or interaction terms of scalar and functional covariates as well as (functional) random effects and allows flexible choices of bases—particularly splines and functional principal components—and corresponding penalties for each term. It covers functional data observed on common (dense) or curve-specific (sparse) grids. Penalized-likelihood-based and gradient-boosting-based inference for these models are implemented in R packages refund and FDboost , respectively. We also discuss identifiability and computational complexity for the functional regression models covered.

	abstract = {Invariance of the measurement model (MM) between subjects and within subjects over time is a prerequisite for drawing valid inferences when studying dynamics of psychological factors in intensive longitudinal data. To conveniently evaluate this invariance, latent Markov factor analysis (LMFA) was proposed. LMFA combines a latent Markov model with mixture factor analysis: The Markov model captures changes in MMs over time by clustering subjects’ observations into a few states and state-specific factor analyses reveal what the MMs look like. However, to estimate the model, Vogelsmeier, Vermunt, van Roekel, and De Roover (2019) introduced a one-step (full information maximum likelihood; FIML) approach that is counterintuitive for applied researchers and entails cumbersome model selection procedures in the presence of many covariates. In this paper, we simplify the complex LMFA estimation and facilitate the exploration of covariate effects on state memberships by splitting the estimation in three intuitive steps: (1) obtain states with mixture factor analysis while treating repeated measures as independent, (2) assign observations to the states, and (3) use these states in a discrete- or continuous-time latent Markov model taking into account classification errors. A real data example demonstrates the empirical value.},

However, research on valid state measures is lagging behind. Only a few instruments have been developed and validated to specifically assess states in EMA studies. Oftentimes, researchers create their own items or adapt existing trait instruments to capture momentary experiences, but do not evaluate their psychometric properties, which leaves the statistical inferences questionable. We present a three-step procedure to facilitate the development of state measures. The first step comprises the definition of the measured construct, intended purpose, and targeted population. In the second step, a candidate pool of items and the response options are generated. In the third step, the psychometric properties of the items are evaluated. Specifically, we describe how to select well-performing items by tailoring a brute-force algorithm to optimize different criteria simultaneously. We further draw attention to important measurement topics such as planned missingness designs and longitudinal measurement invariance. The three steps are illustrated by means of an empirical example, where we execute and document the full procedure to develop a new instrument to measure well-being in everyday life.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Experience sampling methodology studies, in which participants complete questionnaires multiple times a day over an extended period, are increasingly popular in the social sciences in general and quality-of-life research in particular. The intensive longitudinal methods allow for studying the dynamics of constructs (e.g., how much patient-reported outcomes (PROs) vary across time). These methods promise higher ecological validity and lower recall bias than traditional methods that question participants only once, since the high frequency means that participants complete questionnaires in their everyday lives and do not have to retrospectively report about a large time interval. However, to ensure the validity of the results obtained from analyzing the intensive longitudinal data (ILD), greater awareness and understanding of appropriate measurement practices are needed. Method: We surveyed 42 researchers experienced with ILD regarding their measurement practices and reasons for suboptimal practices. Results: Results showed that researchers typically do not use measures validated specifically for ILD. Participants assessing the psychometric properties and invariance of measures in their current studies was even less common, as was accounting for these properties when analyzing dynamics. This was mainly because participants did not have the necessary knowledge to conduct these assessments or were unaware of their importance for drawing valid inferences. Open science practices, in contrast, appear reasonably well ingrained in ILD studies. Conclusion: Measurement practices in ILD still need to be improved in some key areas, and we provide recommendations for this in order to create a solid foundation for measuring and analyzing psychological constructs.},

Frequentist and Bayesian inferences are compared. A key feature of the method proposed is that it allows us to make systematic inference on all model components within a unified parametric mixed model framework and can be easily implemented by fitting a working generalized linear mixed model by using existing statistical software.

              A general method for constructing low‐rank tensor product smooths for use as components of generalized additive models or generalized additive mixed models is presented. A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these “marginal” smooths being represented using a low‐rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no “natural” way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single‐penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},

	abstract = {Intensive longitudinal data provide psychological researchers with the potential to better understand individual-level temporal processes. While the collection of such data has become increasingly common, there are a comparatively small number of methods well-suited for analyzing these data, and many methods assume homogeneity across individuals. A recent development rooted in structural equation and vector autoregressive modeling, Subgrouping Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (S-GIMME), provides one method for arriving at individual-level models composed of processes shared by the sample, a subset of the sample, and a given individual. As this algorithm was motivated and validated for use with neuroimaging data, its performance is less understood in the context of ambulatory assessment data. Here, we evaluate the performance of the S-GIMME algorithm across various conditions frequently encountered with daily diary (compared to neuroimaging) data; namely, a smaller number of variables, a lower number of time points, and smaller autoregressive effects. We demonstrate, for the first time, the importance of the autoregressive effects in recovering data-generating connections and directions, and the ability to use S-GIMME with lengths of data commonly seen in daily diary studies. We demonstrate the use of S-GIMME with an empirical example evaluating the general, shared, and unique temporal processes associated with a sample of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Finally, we underscore the need for methods such as S-GIMME moving forward given the increasing use of intensive longitudinal data in psychological research, and the potential for these data to provide novel insights into human behavior and mental health.},

For this general class of models, an important issue in practice is to address the necessity of modeling the regression function as nonlinear and time-varying. To tackle this, we propose an information criterion and prove its selection consistency property. The results are applied to the U.S. Treasury interest rate data.},

This paper introduces the R package NTS that offers various computational tools and nonlinear models for analyzing nonlinear dependent data. The package ﬁlls the gaps of several outstanding R packages for nonlinear time series analysis. Speciﬁcally, the NTS package covers the implementation of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, autoregressive conditional mean models with exogenous variables (ACMx), functional autoregressive models, and state-space models. Users can also evaluate and compare the performance of different models and select the best one for prediction. Furthermore, the package implements ﬂexible and comprehensive sequential Monte Carlo methods (also known as particle ﬁlters) for modeling non-Gaussian or nonlinear processes. Several examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the NTS package.},

	abstract = {Often, in the analysis of time series and digital signals, a smoothing procedure is required to filter undesired random perturbations as noise and outliers in data. Among the most widely known techniques for time series smoothing, we have convolutional filters, simple exponential smoothing, triple exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters method) and linear adaptive filters, such as the Wiener filter. In this paper, we propose the NoLAW filter (Non-Linear Adaptive Wiener filter ), a higher-order nonlinear extension for the adaptive Wiener filter, which is a linear statistical smoothing technique that assumes the hypothesis that the underlying series is corrupted by a zero mean, additive and independent Gaussian noise. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is a computationally efficient and viable approach for filtering time series. Quantitative metrics show that the NoLAW filter is capable of producing better results than the usual linear Wiener filter, simple exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters method. Moreover, the computational cost of the proposed NoLAW is linear in the number of samples, which means that, asymptotically, it is equivalent to the regular Wiener filter.},

However, the non-factorisability of the lower bound prevents truly scalable inference. In this work, we study the doubly stochastic formulation of the Bayesian GPLVM model amenable with minibatch training. We show how this framework is compatible with diﬀerent latent variable formulations and perform experiments to compare a suite of models. Further, we demonstrate how we can train in the presence of massively missing data and obtain high-ﬁdelity reconstructions.We demonstrate the model’s performance by benchmarking against the canonical sparse GPLVM for high dimensional data examples.},

The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

Next, we study the effect of socioeconomic status on brain structure, using data on education and income together with hippocampal volumes estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. By combining semiparametric estimation with latent variable modeling, GALAMMs allow a more realistic representation of how brain and cognition vary across the lifespan, while simultaneously estimating latent traits from measured items.

The proposed method models the TVAR coefficients locally by polynomials and estimates those using least-squares estimation with a kernel having a certain bandwidth. A data-driven variable bandwidth selection method is developed to obtain the optimal bandwidth, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). Simulation results show that the LPM-based TVAR identification method outperforms conventional methods for different scenarios. The advantages of the LPM method make it a useful high-resolution timefrequency analysis (TFA) technique for nonstationary biomedical signals like EEG. Experimental results show that the LPM method can reveal more meaningful time-frequency characteristics than wavelet transform.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from many neurons on individual experimental trials. Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories—Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)—which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.},

	abstract = {Determining trend and implementing detrending operations are important steps in data analysis. Yet there is no precise definition of “trend” nor any logical algorithm for extracting it. As a result, various ad hoc extrinsic methods have been used to determine trend and to facilitate a detrending operation. In this article, a simple and logical definition of trend is given for any nonlinear and nonstationary time series as an intrinsically determined monotonic function within a certain temporal span (most often that of the data span), or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within that temporal span. Being intrinsic, the method to derive the trend has to be adaptive. This definition of trend also presumes the existence of a natural time scale. All these requirements suggest the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method as the logical choice of algorithm for extracting various trends from a data set. Once the trend is determined, the corresponding detrending operation can be implemented. With this definition of trend, the variability of the data on various time scales also can be derived naturally. Climate data are used to illustrate the determination of the intrinsic trend and natural variability.},

Although having a number of benefits over other methods, the use and analysis of AA data may pose specific challenges. Among these, the issue of dealing with diurnal cycles in emotion data has received relative scant attention. This paper therefore discusses why cyclic models may be considered for analysing AA data on emotions, and describes how this approach can be applied to an empirical AA dataset. Results suggest that cyclic modelling may be a useful method for describing and accounting for (diurnal) cyclic patterns in AA data, but should be used with a number of considerations in mind.},

Then we propose an alternative method that models inter-individual differences in intra-individual variability by separately considering both the amplitude of fluctuations and temporal dependency in the data. In the proposed model, temporal dependency and amplitude of fluctuations are both included as random effects. Parameter estimation is done with a multiple-step approach using maximum likelihood, or with a recommended one-step approach using a Bayesian method. The similarity and differences between the proposed method and some existing methods are discussed and investigated using diary study data from older adults. The results from empirical data analysis revealed that temporal dependency and amplitude of fluctuations have different predictability of health outcomes and thus should be modeled and considered separately.},

This method has the advantage of being able to not only assess people’s general feelings, but to link feelings with situations, times of day, and other circumstances. Thus, ESM provides a powerful way of moving beyond simple questions about who is “happy” and who is not, to more intricate questions about when and why people experience positive and negative feelings. Compared to retrospective reports of feelings, ESM is less inﬂuenced by memory biases. ESM also allows researchers to analyze the patterning and relationships of feelings as they unfold over time. Despite the strengths and promise of this method, there are also limitations. For example, the heavy demand placed on research participants means that the sample might be biased toward highly conscientious individuals, and repeatedly reporting one’s moods might itself inﬂuence feelings. How to analyze ESM data is discussed, including the issue of how to aggregate momentary feelings into global measures of the average subjective well-being of individuals.},

Language learning, on this view, is a process of experience-dependent shaping and selection of broadly deﬁned domain-general and domain-speciﬁc genetic predispositions. The central concept of development is (neuro)cognitive growth in terms of self-organization. Linguistic structure-building is synergetic and emergent insofar as the acquisition of a critical mass of elements on a local level (e.g., words) results in the emergence of novel qualities and units on a macroscopic level (e.g., syntax). We argue that language development does not take a linear path but comes in phases of intermittent turbulence, ﬂuctuation, and stability, along a ‘‘chaotic itinerary’’. We review qualitative, quantitative and computational applications of this concept in the lexical, morphological, and syntactic domain. We identify as the most signiﬁcant property of the dynamic approach the temporal nature of language learning. As a medium-term forecast we anticipate a further diversiﬁcation of the dynamic approach, an increase in more formal approaches, and a stronger interest in issues of embodiment and embeddedness.},

	abstract = {This dissertation presents the results of a study investigating the diachronic development of complexity, accuracy, and fluency in second language oral production. Consistent with the axiology of dynamic systems theory, the mutable nature of the complex linguistic system as well as the emphasis on intra-individual variability are underscored within the methodological considerations informing this study. As such, a process-oriented, non-linear time series analysis was carried out to address the following research questions: (a) In what ways do the constructs of complexity, accuracy, and fluency develop longitudinally in a single untutored learner of ESL across multiple language tasks?; (b) To what extent do the relationships between these constructs change over one academic year in an English-speaking context?; and (c) In what ways does the diachronic development of syntactic complexity exhibit the characteristics of self-similarity (i.e., fractality)? Data were collected from an individual untutored learner of English as a second language on a weekly basis from two disparate oral tasks (viz., dialogic conversation and monologic narrative) for the period of one academic year. The density of data collection—consistent with a complexity perspective—provided sufficient granularity for the developmental trajectories of nine subcomponents of complexity, accuracy, and fluency to be scrutinized in terms of their growth, regression, and, equally, the synergistic relationship among these constructs.

Results of the non-linear time analysis confirm several assumptions regarding the nature of language as a complex dynamic system. Findings illustrate the ways in which grammatical complexity, accuracy, and fluency develop uniquely across tasks. In addition, the complex relationships between these domains demonstrate the dynamism within the interconnectedness of the components of the complex linguistic system and, ultimately, how such relationships develop uniquely over time to support language development. In addition, results indicate that, typical of chaotic systems, language development demonstrates self-similarity (i.e., fractality) across temporal levels and equally passes through periods of bifurcation in which complexity, accuracy, and fluency interact uniquely to promote the transition between attractor states.},

	abstract = {Background: A defining characteristic of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is its episodic course, which might indicate that MDD is a nonlinear dynamic phenomenon with two discrete states. We investigated this hypothesis using the symptom time series of individual patients.
Methods: In 178 primary care patients with MDD, the presence of the nine DSM-IV symptoms of depression was recorded weekly for two years. For each patient, the time-series plots as well as the frequency distributions of the symptoms over 104 weeks were inspected. Furthermore, two indicators of bimodality were obtained: the bimodality coefficient (BC) and the fit of a 1- and a 2-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
Results: In 66 \% of the sample, high bimodality coefficients (BC {\textgreater} .55) were found. These corresponded to relatively sudden jumps in the symptom curves and to highly skewed or bimodal frequency distributions. The results of the HMM analyses classified 90 \% of the symptom distributions as bimodal.
Conclusions: A two-state pattern can be used to describe the course of depression symptoms in many patients. The BC seems useful in differentiating between subgroups of MDD patients based on their life course data.},

If participants download the right “psych apps,” smartphones can record where they are, what they are doing, and what they can see and hear and can run interactive surveys, tests, and experiments through touch screens and wireless connections to nearby screens, headsets, biosensors, and other peripherals. This article reviews previous behavioral research using mobile electronic devices, outlines what smartphones can do now and will be able to do in the near future, explains how a smartphone study could work practically given current technology (e.g., in studying ovulatory cycle effects on women’s sexuality), discusses some limitations and challenges of smartphone research, and compares smartphones to other research methods. Smartphone research will require new skills in app development and data analysis and will raise tough new ethical issues, but smartphones could transform psychology even more profoundly than PCs and brain imaging did.},

	abstract = {Significance
            As complex systems such as the climate or ecosystems approach a tipping point, their dynamics tend to become dominated by a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. Using time series of autorecorded mood, we show that indicators of slowing down are also predictive of future transitions in depression. Specifically, in persons who are more likely to have a future transition, mood dynamics are slower and different aspects of mood are more correlated. This supports the view that the mood system may have tipping points where reinforcing feedbacks among a web of symptoms can propagate a person into a disorder. Our findings suggest the possibility of early warning systems for psychiatric disorders, using smartphone-based mood monitoring.
          , 
            About 17\% of humanity goes through an episode of major depression at some point in their lifetime. Despite the enormous societal costs of this incapacitating disorder, it is largely unknown how the likelihood of falling into a depressive episode can be assessed. Here, we show for a large group of healthy individuals and patients that the probability of an upcoming shift between a depressed and a normal state is related to elevated temporal autocorrelation, variance, and correlation between emotions in fluctuations of autorecorded emotions. These are indicators of the general phenomenon of critical slowing down, which is expected to occur when a system approaches a tipping point. Our results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of elevated mood interspersed with episodes of depression. While treatment developments and understanding the disruptive nature of this illness have focused on these episodes, it is also evident that some patients may have chronic week-to-week mood instability. This is also a major morbidity. The longitudinal pattern of this mood instability is poorly understood as it has, until recently, been difficult to quantify. We propose that understanding this mood variability is critical for the development of cognitive neuroscience-based treatments. In this study, we develop a time-series approach to capture mood variability in two groups of patients with bipolar disorder who appear on the basis of clinical judgement to show relatively stable or unstable illness courses. Using weekly mood scores based on a self-rated scale (quick inventory of depressive symptomatology—self-rated; QIDS-SR) from 23 patients over a 220-week period, we show that the observed mood variability is nonlinear and that the stable and unstable patient groups are described by different nonlinear time-series processes. We emphasize the necessity in combining both appropriate measures of the underlying deterministic processes (the QIDS-SR score) and noise (uncharacterized temporal variation) in understanding dynamical patterns of mood variability associated with bipolar disorder.},

Employees’ perceptions of challenge and skill and their subjective experiences in terms of enjoyment, interest and absorption were measured using the experience sampling method, yielding a total of 6981 observations from a sample of 60 employees. Linear and nonlinear approaches were applied in order to model both continuous and sudden changes. According to the R2, AICc and BIC indexes, the nonlinear dynamical systems model (i.e. cusp catastrophe model) fit the data better than the linear and logistic regression models. Likewise, the cusp catastrophe model appears to be especially powerful for modelling those cases of high levels of flow. Overall, flow represents a nonequilibrium condition that combines continuous and abrupt changes across time. Research and intervention efforts concerned with this process should focus on the variable of challenge, which, according to our study, appears to play a key role in the abrupt changes observed in work-related flow.},

However, the vast majority of applications of autoregressive time series analyses in psychology do not take measurement error into account. Disregarding measurement error when it is present in the data results in a bias of the autoregressive parameters. We discuss two models that take measurement error into account: An autoregressive model with a white noise term (AR+WN), and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. In a simulation study we compare the parameter recovery performance of these models, and compare this performance for both a Bayesian and frequentist approach. We ﬁnd that overall, the AR+WN model performs better. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that for realistic (i.e., small) sample sizes, psychological research would beneﬁt from a Bayesian approach in ﬁtting these models. Finally, we illustrate the effect of disregarding measurement error in an AR(1) model by means of an empirical application on mood data in women. We ﬁnd that, depending on the person, approximately 30–50\% of the total variance was due to measurement error, and that disregarding this measurement error results in a substantial underestimation of the autoregressive parameters.},

This paper demonstrates how to incorporate measurement models into DSEM to (1) provide more rigorous measurement of constructs used in intensive longitudinal studies and (2) assess whether scales are invariant across time and across people, which is not possible when item responses are summed or averaged. We provide an example from an ecological momentary assessment study on self-regulation in adults with binge eating disorder and walkthrough how to fit the model in Mplus and how to interpret the results.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Experience sampling methodology studies, in which participants complete questionnaires multiple times a day over an extended period, are increasingly popular in the social sciences in general and quality-of-life research in particular. The intensive longitudinal methods allow for studying the dynamics of constructs (e.g., how much patient-reported outcomes (PROs) vary across time). These methods promise higher ecological validity and lower recall bias than traditional methods that question participants only once, since the high frequency means that participants complete questionnaires in their everyday lives and do not have to retrospectively report about a large time interval. However, to ensure the validity of the results obtained from analyzing the intensive longitudinal data (ILD), greater awareness and understanding of appropriate measurement practices are needed.
Method: We surveyed 42 researchers experienced with ILD regarding their measurement practices and reasons for suboptimal practices.
Results: Results showed that researchers typically do not use measures validated specifically for ILD. Participants assessing the psychometric properties and invariance of measures in their current studies was even less common, as was accounting for these properties when analyzing dynamics. This was mainly because participants did not have the necessary knowledge to conduct these assessments or were unaware of their importance for drawing valid inferences. Open science practices, in contrast, appear reasonably well ingrained in ILD studies.
Conclusion: Measurement practices in ILD still need to be improved in some key areas, and we provide recommendations for this in order to create a solid foundation for measuring and analyzing psychological constructs.},

	abstract = {In linear regression problems with many predictors, penalized regression techniques are often used to guard against overfitting and to select variables relevant for predicting an outcome variable. Recently, Bayesian penalization is becoming increasingly popular in which the prior distribution performs a function similar to that of the penalty term in classical penalization. Specifically, the so-called shrinkage priors in Bayesian penalization aim to shrink small effects to zero while maintaining true large effects. Compared to classical penalization techniques, Bayesian penalization techniques perform similarly or sometimes even better, and they offer additional advantages such as readily available uncertainty estimates, automatic estimation of the penalty parameter, and more flexibility in terms of penalties that can be considered. However, many different shrinkage priors exist and the available, often quite technical, literature primarily focuses on presenting one shrinkage prior and often provides comparisons with only one or two other shrinkage priors. This can make it difficult for researchers to navigate through the many prior options and choose a shrinkage prior for the problem at hand. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on Bayesian penalization. We provide a theoretical and conceptual comparison of nine different shrinkage priors and parametrize the priors, if possible, in terms of scale mixture of normal distributions to facilitate comparisons. We illustrate different characteristics and behaviors of the shrinkage priors and compare their performance in terms of prediction and variable selection in a simulation study. Additionally, we provide two empirical examples to illustrate the application of Bayesian penalization. Finally, an R package bayesreg is available online (https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg) which allows researchers to perform Bayesian penalized regression with novel shrinkage priors in an easy manner.},

For instance, in realistic situations, the false-positive rate can be 100\% for detecting an interaction, and a probed interaction can reliably produce estimated effects of the wrong sign. This paper proposes a revised toolbox for studying interactions in a curvilinear-robust manner, giving correct answers 'even' when effects aren't linear. It's applicable to most study designs, and produces results that are analogous to those of current -often invalid- practices.

	abstract = {This paper discusses key results from the literature in the field of local polynomial regres sion. Local polynomial regression (LPR) is a nonparametric technique for smoothing scatter
plots and modeling functions. For each point, x0, a low-order polynomial WLS regression is
fit using only points in some “neighborhood” of x0. The result is a smooth function over the
support of the data. LPR has good performance on the boundary and is superior to all other
linear smoothers in a minimax sense. The quality of the estimated function is dependent on the
choice of weighting function, K, the size the neighborhood, h, and the order of polynomial fit,
p. We discuss each of these choices, paying particular attention to bandwidth selection. When
choosing h, “plug-in” methods tend to outperform cross-validation methods, but computa tional considerations make the latter a desirable choice. Variable bandwidths are more flexible
than global ones, but both can have good asymptotic and finite-sample properties. Odd-order
polynomial fits are superior to even fits asymptotically, and an adaptive order method that is
robust to bandwidth is discussed. While the Epanechnikov kernel is superior is an asymptotic
minimax sense, a variety are used in practice. Extensions to various types of data and other
applications of LPR are also discussed.},

The problem of objectively choosing the bandwidth of a kernel estimate forf is addressed. It is shown both theoretically and by simulation that crossvalidation produces extremely rough kernel estimates when the data are sufficiently positively correlated. This makes it inadvisable to use residuals from a cross-validated kernel estimate as a means of estimating the covariance function of the errors. Alternative methods of estimating the covariance function are proposed. In a simulation study, incorporating these estimated covariances into a risk estimation procedure leads to more efficient smoothing of positively correlated data.},

	abstract = {Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. These data allow one to estimate models of within-subject dynamics, and thereby avoid the notorious problem of making within-subjects inferences from between-subjects data, and naturally address heterogeneity between subjects. A popular model for these data is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, in which each variable is predicted by a linear function of all variables at previous time points. A key assumption of this model is that its parameters are constant (or stationary) across time. However, in many areas of psychological research time-varying parameters are plausible or even the subject of study. In this tutorial paper, we introduce methods to estimate time-varying VAR models based on splines and kernel-smoothing with/without regularization. We use simulations to evaluate the relative performance of all methods in scenarios typical in applied research, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial showing how to apply the discussed methods to an openly available time series of mood-related measurements.},

	abstract = {I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d 1 dimensional data, which can be ﬁtted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efﬁcient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efﬁciency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

A major difficulty lies in the evaluation of the cross-validation function that requires the calculation of the trace of an inverse matrix. In the last few years stochastic trace estimators have been proposed to alleviate this problem. This article demonstrates numerical approximation techniques that further reduce the computational complexity. The new approach employs Gauss quadrature to compute lower and upper bounds on the cross-validation function. It only requires the operator form of the system matrix--that is, a subroutine to evaluate matrix-vector products. Thus, the factorization of large matrices can be avoided. The new approach has been implemented in MATLAB. Numerical experiments confirm the remarkable accuracy of the stochastic trace estimator. Regularization parameters are computed for ill-posed problems with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 unknowns.},

The development of ALT models has focused primarily on models with linear growth components, but some social processes follow nonlinear trajectories. Although it is straightforward to extend ALT models to allow for some forms of nonlinear trajectories, the identification status of such models, approaches to comparing them with alternative models, and the interpretation of parameters have not been systematically assessed. In this paper we focus on two forms of nonlinear autoregressive latent trajectory (NLALT) models. The first form allows for a quadratic growth trajectory, a popular form of nonlinear latent growth curve models. The second form derives from latent basis models, or freed loading models, that allow for arbitrary growth processes. We discuss details concerning parameterization, model identification, estimation, and testing for the two forms of NLALT models. We include a simulation study that illustrates potential biases that may arise from fitting alternative models to data derived from an autoregressive process and individual-specific nonlinear trajectories. In addition, we include an extended empirical example modeling growth trajectories of weight from birth through age 2.},

We argue that the autoregressive and trajectory models are special cases of a more encompassing model that we call the autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) model. In this paper we detail the underlying statistical theory and mathematical identification of this model, and demonstrate the ALT model using two empirical data sets. The first reanalyzes a simulated repeated measures data set that was previously used to argue against the autoregressive model, and we illustrate how the ALT model can recover the true latent curve model. Second, we apply the ALT model to real family income data on N=3912 adults over a seven year period and find evidence for both autoregressive and latent trajectory processes.

	abstract = {Generalized cross validation (GCV) is one of the most important approaches used to estimate parameters in the context of inverse problems and regularization techniques. A notable example is the determination of the smoothness parameter in splines. When the data are generated by a state space model, like in the spline case, efficient algorithms are available to evaluate the GCV score with complexity that scales linearly in the data set size. However, these methods are not amenable to on-line applications since they rely on forward and backward recursions. Hence, if the objective has been evaluated at time \$t-1\$ and new data arrive at time t, then O(t) operations are needed to update the GCV score. In this paper we instead show that the update cost is \$O(1)\$, thus paving the way to the on-line use of GCV. This result is obtained by deriving the novel GCV filter which extends the classical Kalman filter equations to efficiently propagate the GCV score over time. We also illustrate applications of the new filter in the context of state estimation and on-line regularized linear system identification.},

Fortunately, these models have an incredibly rich tradition in the broader developmental sciences that we can draw from.  Here, we provide a primer on longitudinal models, written in a beginner-friendly (and slightly irreverent) manner, with a particular focus on selecting among different modeling frameworks (e.g., multilevel versus latent curve models) to build the theoretical model of development a researcher wishes to test. Our aims are three-fold: 1) lay out a heuristic framework for longitudinal model selection, 2) build a repository of references that ground each model in its tradition of methodological development and practical implementation with a focus on connecting researchers to resources outside traditional neuroimaging journals, and 3) provide practical resources in the form of a codebook companion demonstrating how to fit these models. These resources together aim to enhance training for the next generation of developmental neuroscientists by providing a solid foundation for future forays into advanced modeling applications.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

We present simulation evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal 'across-the-function' frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identifiability constraints.},

            Gaussian processes are powerful non-parametric probabilistic models for stochastic functions. However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

This model identiﬁes subgroups of individuals with similar traits and dynamic processes, while also allowing for between-individual differences in these attributes within the different subgroups. We illustrate the model in an application to emotion dynamics data. The sample consists of individuals from two different age groups. Using our mixture multilevel vector-autoregressive model, we describe the between-individual differences that are present in the emotion dynamics of this sample. We do so by describing the more homogeneous subgroups that were identiﬁed by our model, and by describing the between-individual differences within the different subgroups.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent dynamics is ubiquitous in the natural world and beyond. Eﬀectively analysing its presence in data is essential to our ability to understand the systems from which it is recorded. However, the traditional framework for dynamics analysis is in terms of time-independent dynamical systems and long-term statistics, as opposed to the explicit tracking over time of time-localised dynamical behaviour. We review commonly used analysis techniques based on this traditional statistical framework—such as the autocorrelation function, power-spectral density, and multiscale sample entropy—and contrast to an alternative framework in terms of ﬁnite-time dynamics of networks of time-dependent cyclic processes. In time-independent systems, the net eﬀect of a large number of individually intractable contributions may be considered as noise; we show that time-dependent oscillator systems with only a small number of contributions may appear noise-like when analysed according to the traditional framework using powerspectral density estimation. However, methods characteristic of the time-dependent ﬁnite-time-dynamics framework, such as the wavelet transform and wavelet bispectrum, are able to identify the determinism and provide crucial information about the analysed system. Finally, we compare these two frameworks for three sets of experimental data. We demonstrate that while techniques based on the traditional framework are unable to reliably detect and understand underlying time-dependent dynamics, the alternative framework identiﬁes deterministic oscillations and interactions.},

A less often quoted contribution of Kalman’s to the control theory literature is that of the concepts of controllability and observability which may be used to analyse the state transition and observation equations and give insights into the ﬁlter’s viability. This paper aims to highlight the usefulness of these two ideas during the design stage of the ﬁlter and, as well as presenting the standard solutions for linear systems, uses a practical vision application (that of tracking plants for an autonomous crop protection vehicle) to illustrate a useful special case where these methods may be applied to a non-linear system. The application of tests for controllability and observability to the practical non-linear system give not only conﬁrmation that the ﬁlter will be able to produce stable estimates, but also gives a lower bound on the number of features required from each image for it to do so.},

              Background
              A growing body of research highlights the limitations of traditional methods for studying the process of change in psychotherapy. The science of complex systems offers a useful paradigm for studying patterns of psychopathology and the development of more functional patterns in psychotherapy. Some basic principles of change are presented from subdisciplines of complexity science that are particularly relevant to psychotherapy: dynamical systems theory, synergetics, and network theory. Two early warning signs of system transition that have been identified across sciences (critical fluctuations and critical slowing) are also described. The network destabilization and transition (NDT) model of therapeutic change is presented as a conceptual framework to import these principles to psychotherapy research and to suggest future research directions.
            
            
              Discussion
              A complex systems approach has a number of implications for psychotherapy research. We describe important design considerations, targets for research, and analytic tools that can be used to conduct this type of research.
            
            
              Conclusions
              A complex systems approach to psychotherapy research is both viable and necessary to more fully capture the dynamics of human change processes. Research to date suggests that the process of change in psychotherapy can be nonlinear and that periods of increased variability and critical slowing might be early warning signals of transition in psychotherapy, as they are in other systems in nature. Psychotherapy research has been limited by small samples and infrequent assessment, but ambulatory and electronic methods now allow researchers to more fully realize the potential of concepts and methods from complexity science.},

              Objective
              Symptom counts as the basis for Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnoses in the DSM presume each symptom is equally reflective of underlying disorder severity. However, the “equal weight” assumption fails to fit PTSD symptom data when tested. The present study developed an enhanced PTSD diagnosis based on (a) a conventional PTSD diagnosis from a clinical interview and (b) an empirical classification of full PTSD that reflected the relative clinical weights of each symptom.
            
            
              Method
              
                Baseline structured interview data from Project Harmony (
                N
                 = 2658) was used. An enhanced diagnosis for full PTSD was estimated using an empirical threshold from moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) latent PTSD scale scores, in combination with a full conventional PTSD diagnosis based on interview data.
              
            
            
              Results
              One in 4 patients in the sample had a PTSD diagnosis that was inconsistent with their empirical PTSD grouping, such that the enhanced diagnostic standard reduced the diagnostic discrepancy rate by 20\%. Veterans, and in particular female Veterans, were at greatest odds for discrepancy between their underlying PTSD severity and DSM diagnosis.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Psychometric methodologies that differentially weight symptoms can complement DSM criteria and may serve as a platform for symptom prioritization for diagnoses in future editions of DSM.},

	abstract = {Ecological Momentary Assessments (i.e., EMA, repeated assessments in daily life) are widespread in many fields of psychology and related disciplines. Yet, little knowledge exists on how differences in study designs and samples predict study compliance and dropout—two central parameters of data quality in (micro-)longitudinal research. The current meta-analysis included k = 477 articles (496 samples, total N = 677,536). For each article, we coded the design, sample characteristics, compliance, and dropout rate. The results showed that on average EMA studies scheduled six assessments per day, lasted for 7 days, and obtained a compliance of 79\%. Studies with more assessments per day scheduled fewer assessment days, yet, the number of assessments did not predict compliance or dropout rates. Compliance was significantly higher in studies providing financial incentives. Otherwise, design or sample characteristics had little effects. We discuss the implications of the findings for planning, reporting, and reviewing EMA studies.},

	abstract = {Reliability is a key concept in psychology that has been broadly studied since the introduction of Cronbach's alpha, which is a measure of the internal consistency of a test. Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data. We also showcase their application with empirical data.},

	abstract = {The experience sampling method (ESM) captures psychological experiences over time and in everyday contexts, thereby offering exciting potential for collecting more temporally fine-grained and ecologically valid data for psychological research. Given that rapid methodological developments make it increasingly difficult for novice ESM researchers to be well-informed about standards of ESM research and to identify resources that can serve as useful starting points, this article provides a primer on ten essential design and implementation considerations for ESM studies. Specifically, we i) compare ESM with cross-sectional, panel, and cohort approaches, and discuss considerations regarding: ii) item content and phrasing, iii) choosing and formulating response options, iv) timescale (sampling: frequency, scheme, and duration), v) change properties and stationarity, vi) power and effect sizes, vii) missingness, attrition, and compliance, viii) data assessment and administration, ix) reliability, as well as x) replicability and generalizability. For all ten topics we discuss challenges and – if available – potential solutions, and provide literature that can serve as starting points for more in-depth readings. We also share access to a living, web-based resources library with a more extensive catalogue of literature, to facilitate further learning about the design and implementation of ESM. Lastly, we list topics that were beyond the scope of our article, but can be relevant for the success of ESM studies. Taken together, our article highlights the most essential design and implementation considerations for ESM studies, aids the identification of relevant in-depth readings, and can thereby support the quality of future ESM studies.},

	abstract = {We explore the connections between Green's functions for certain differential equations, covariance functions for Gaussian processes, and the smoothing splines problem. Conventionally, the smoothing spline problem is considered in a setting of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, but here we present a more direct approach. With this approach, some choices that are implicit in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting stand out, one example being choice of boundary conditions and more elaborate shape restrictions. The paper first explores the Laplace operator and the Poisson equation and studies the corresponding Green's functions under various boundary conditions and constraints. Explicit functional forms are derived in a range of examples. These examples include several novel forms of the Green's function that, to the author's knowledge, have not previously been presented. Next we present a smoothing spline problem where we penalize the integrated squared derivative of the function to be estimated. We then show how the solution can be explicitly computed using the Green's function for the Laplace operator. In the last part of the paper, we explore the connection between Gaussian processes and differential equations, and show how the Laplace operator is related to Brownian processes and how processes that arise due to boundary conditions and shape constraints can be viewed as conditional Gaussian processes. The presented connection between Green's functions for the Laplace operator and covariance functions for Brownian processes allows us to introduce several new novel Brownian processes with specific behaviors. Finally, we consider the connection between Gaussian process priors and smoothing splines.},

            Spline and generalized spline smoothing is shown to be equivalent to Bayesian estimation with a partially improper prior. This result supports the idea that spline smoothing is a natural solution to the regression problem when one is given a set of regression functions but one also wants to hedge against the possibility that the true model is not exactly in the span of the given regression functions. A natural measure of the deviation of the true model from the span of the regression functions comes out of the spline theory in a natural way. An appropriate value of this measure can be estimated from the data and used to constrain the estimated model to have the estimated deviation. Some convergence results and computational tricks are also discussed.},

                  Generalised additive models (GAMs) are increasingly popular tools for estimating smooth nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables. GAMs are particularly relevant in ecology for representing hierarchical functions for discrete responses that encompass complex features including zero inflation, truncation and uneven sampling. However, GAMs are less useful for producing forecasts as their smooth functions provide unstable predictions outside the range of training data.
                
                
                  
                    We introduce dynamic generalised additive models (DGAMs), where the GAM linear predictor is jointly estimated with unobserved dynamic components to model time series that evolve as a function of nonlinear predictor associations and latent temporal processes. These models are especially useful for analysing multiple series, as they can estimate hierarchical smooth functions while learning complex temporal associations via dimension‐reduced latent factor processes. We implement our models in the
                    mvgam
                    R package, which estimates unobserved parameters for smoothing splines and latent temporal processes in a probabilistic framework.

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            When estimating a mean regression function and its derivatives, locally weighted least squares regression has proven to be a very attractive technique. The present paper focuses on the important issue of how to select the smoothing parameter or bandwidth. In the case of estimating curves with a complicated structure, a variable bandwidth is desirable. Furthermore, the bandwidth should be indicated by the data themselves. Recent developments in nonparametric smoothing techniques inspired us to propose such a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure, which can be used to select both constant and variable bandwidths. The idea is based on a residual squares criterion along with a good approximation of the bias and variance of the estimator. The procedure can be applied to select bandwidths not only for estimating the regression curve but also for estimating its derivatives. The resulting estimation procedure has the necessary flexibility for capturing complicated shapes of curves. This is illustrated via a large variety of testing examples, including examples with a large spatial variability. The results are also compared with wavelet thresholding techniques, and it seems that our results are at least comparable, i.e. local polynomial regression using our data-driven variable bandwidth has spatial adaptation properties that are similar to wavelets.},

However, the quality of simulation studies can vary widely in terms of their design, execution, and reporting. In order to assess the quality of typical simulation studies in psychology, we reviewed 321 articles published in Psychological Methods, Behavioral Research Methods, and Multivariate Behavioral Research in 2021 and 2022, among which 100/321 = 31.2\% report a simulation study. We find that many articles do not provide complete and transparent information about key aspects of the study, such as justifications for the number of simulation repetitions, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimates, or code and data to reproduce the simulation studies. To address this problem, we provide a summary of the ADEMP (Aims, Data-generating mechanism, Estimands and other targets, Methods, Performance measures) design and reporting framework from Morris, White, and Crowther (2019) adapted to simulation studies in psychology. Based on this framework, we provide ADEMP-PreReg, a step-by-step template for researchers to use when designing, potentially preregistering, and reporting their simulation studies. We give formulae for estimating common performance measures, their Monte Carlo standard errors, and for calculating the number of simulation repetitions to achieve a desired Monte Carlo standard error. Finally, we give a detailed tutorial on how to apply the ADEMP framework in practice using an example simulation study on the evaluation of methods for the analysis of pre–post measurement experiments.},

TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) is a statistical framework of major relevance for research concerned with people’s intrapersonal dynamics. An application domain that is rapidly gaining relevance is the study of individual differences in the within-person association (WPA) of variables that fluctuate over time. For instance, an individual’s social reactivity – their emotional response to social situations – can be represented as the association between repeated measurements of the individual’s social interaction quantity and momentary well-being. MSEM allows researchers to investigate the associations between WPAs and person-level outcome variables (e.g., life satisfaction) by specifying the WPAs as random slopes in the structural equation on level 1 and using the latent representations of the slopes to predict outcomes on level 2. Here, we are concerned with the case in which a researcher is interested in nonlinear effects of WPAs on person-level outcomes – a U-shaped effect of a WPA, a moderation effect of two WPAs, or an effect of congruence between two WPAs – such that the corresponding MSEM includes latent interactions between random slopes. We evaluate the nonlinear MSEM approach for the three classes of nonlinear effects (U-shaped, moderation, congruence) and compare it with three simpler approaches: a simple two-step approach, a single-indicator approach, and a plausible values approach. We use a simulation study to compare the approaches on accuracy of parameter estimates and inference. We derive recommendations for practice and provide code templates and an illustrative example to help researchers implement the approaches.},

	abstract = {In this study, we conduct a thorough and meticulous examination of the Runge phenomenon. Initially, we engage in an extensive review of relevant literature, which aids in delineating the genesis and essence of the Runge phenomenon, along with an exploration of both conventional and contemporary algorithmic solutions. Subsequently, the paper delves into a diverse array of resolution methodologies, encompassing classical numerical approaches, regularization techniques, mock-Chebyshev interpolation, the TISI (Three-Interval Interpolation Strategy), external pseudo-constraint interpolation, and interpolation strategies predicated upon Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). For each method, we not only introduce but also innovate a novel algorithm to effectively address the phenomenon. This paper executes detailed numerical computations for each method, employing visualization techniques to vividly illustrate the efficacy of various strategies in mitigating the Runge phenomenon. Our findings reveal that although traditional methods exhibit commendable performance in certain instances, novel approaches such as mock-Chebyshev interpolation and regularization-centric methods demonstrate marked superiority in specific contexts. Moreover, the paper provides a critical analysis of these methodologies, specifically highlighting the constraints and potential avenues for enhancement in SVD decomposition-based interpolation strategies. In conclusion, we propose future research trajectories and underscore the imperative of further exploration into interpolation strategies, with an emphasis on their practical application validation. This article serves not only as a comprehensive resource on the Runge phenomenon for researchers but also offers pragmatic guidance for resolving real-world interpolation challenges.},

Importantly, whether studies are suitable for idiographic and/or nomothetic inferences is not categorical but rather a matter of degree. Therefore, we propose a list of concrete, better-defined methodological aspects characterizing individual studies. Specifically, we highlight 16 different decisions researchers have to make pertaining to (1) research question, (2) research design, and (3) analyses and interpretation. These decisions are introduced with a focus on personality psychology but apply to psychological research broadly. We discuss the different decisions with an emphasis on their relation to idiographic and nomothetic inferential goals. Rather than providing specific recommendations, we emphasize the importance of aligning the methodology of a given study with the research question and theory. Overall, this overview seeks to help researchers make relevant decisions more intentionally to help them tailor their studies to their inferential goals.},

              We study the coverage properties of Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs) represented using any penalized regression spline approach. The intervals are the usual generalization of the intervals first proposed by Wahba and Silverman in 1983 and 1985, respectively, to the GAM component context. We present simulation evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal ‘across‐the‐function’ frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by
              Nychka in 1988
              for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for component‐wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identifiability constraints.},

The test can be used (i) in substantive research for assessing the nature of the relationship between certain variables based on scientific expectations, and (ii) for statistical model building to infer whether a (transformed) variable should be added as a linear or nonlinear predictor in a regression model. Under the nonlinear model, a Gaussian process prior is employed using a parameterization similar to Zellner’s g prior resulting in a scale-invariant test. Unlike existing p-values, the proposed Bayes factor can be used for quantifying the relative evidence in the data in favor of linearity. Furthermore the Bayes factor does not overestimate the evidence against the linear null model resulting in more parsimonious models. An extension is proposed for Bayesian one-sided testing of whether a nonlinear effect is consistently positive, consistently negative, or neither. Applications are provided from various fields including social network research and education.},

We present a new PMCMC algorithm that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS). PGAS provides the data analyst with an oﬀ-the-shelf class of Markov kernels that can be used to simulate, for instance, the typically high-dimensional and highly autocorrelated state trajectory in a state-space model. The ancestor sampling procedure enables fast mixing of the PGAS kernel even when using seemingly few particles in the underlying SMC sampler. This is important as it can signiﬁcantly reduce the computational burden that is typically associated with using SMC. PGAS is conceptually similar to the existing PG with backward simulation (PGBS) procedure. Instead of using separate forward and backward sweeps as in PGBS, however, we achieve the same eﬀect in a single forward sweep. This makes PGAS well suited for addressing inference problems not only in state-space models, but also in models with more complex dependencies, such as non-Markovian, Bayesian nonparametric, and general probabilistic graphical models.},

This study empirically investigates DSEM using recently published data to explore its strengths and potential limitations. The results show that while some of its parameter estimates are stable, others are characterized by substantial variation as a function of seemingly innocuous initial model estimation conditions. Indeed, some parameters fluctuate between significance and non-significance for the same model estimated using the same data. The instability of DSEM estimates poses a serious threat to the internal and external validity of conclusions drawn from its analyses, challenging the reproducibility of findings from applied research. Given the recent focus on the replication crisis in psychology, it is critical to address these issues as the popularity of DSEM in psychological research continues to rise. Several potential solutions are investigated to address this problem and recommendations of best practice are offered to applied researchers who plan to use DSEM in intensive longitudinal data analysis.},

First, we introduce bridge sampling and three related sampling methods using the beta-binomial model as a running example. We then apply bridge sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood for the Expectancy Valence (EV) model—a popular model for reinforcement learning. Our results indicate that bridge sampling provides accurate estimates for both a single participant and a hierarchical version of the EV model.

Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efﬁcient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a Lévy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$. On this approximate eigenbasis the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(nm{\textasciicircum}2)\$ (initial) and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(m{\textasciicircum}3)\$ (hyperparameter learning) with \$m\$ basis functions and \$n\$ data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function is increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}1/m\$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.},

Partitioning input data points, we present a two-layer hierarchical model for GP regression, where prototypes of clusters in the upper layer are involved for coarse modeling by a GP and data points in each cluster in the lower layer are involved for ﬁne modeling by an individual GP whose prior mean is given by the corresponding prototype and covariance is parameterized by data points in the partition. In this hierarchical model, integrating out latent variables in the upper layer leads to a block covariance matrix, where diagonal blocks contain similarities between data points in the same partition and oﬀ-diagonal blocks consist of approximate similarities calculated using prototypes. This particular structure of the covariance matrix divides the full GP into a pieces of manageable sub-problems whose complexity scales with the number of data points in a partition. In addition, our hierarchical GP regression (HGPR) is also useful for cases where partitions of data reveal diﬀerent characteristics. Experiments on several benchmark datasets conﬁrm the useful behavior of our method.},

Such models are natural to formulate and can be analyzed mathematically and numerically. However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

We present a new PMCMC algorithm that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS). PGAS provides the data analyst with an oﬀ-the-shelf class of Markov kernels that can be used to simulate, for instance, the typically high-dimensional and highly autocorrelated state trajectory in a state-space model. The ancestor sampling procedure enables fast mixing of the PGAS kernel even when using seemingly few particles in the underlying SMC sampler. This is important as it can signiﬁcantly reduce the computational burden that is typically associated with using SMC. PGAS is conceptually similar to the existing PG with backward simulation (PGBS) procedure. Instead of using separate forward and backward sweeps as in PGBS, however, we achieve the same eﬀect in a single forward sweep. This makes PGAS well suited for addressing inference problems not only in state-space models, but also in models with more complex dependencies, such as non-Markovian, Bayesian nonparametric, and general probabilistic graphical models.},

In this paper we propose Metropolis Augmented Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MAHMC), an HMC variant that allows MH updates within HMC and eliminates this trade-oﬀ.

	abstract = {We consider the generic problem of performing sequential Bayesian inference in a statespace model with observation process y, state process x and ﬁxed parameter θ. An idealized approach would be to apply the iterated batch importance sampling (IBIS) algorithm of Chopin (2002). This is a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm in the θ-dimension, that samples values of θ, reweights iteratively these values using the likelihood increments p(yt{\textbar}y1:t−1, θ), and rejuvenates the θ-particles through a resampling step and a MCMC update step. In state-space models these likelihood increments are intractable in most cases, but they may be unbiasedly estimated by a particle ﬁlter in the x-dimension, for any ﬁxed θ. This motivates the SMC2 algorithm proposed in this article: a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, deﬁned in the θ-dimension, which propagates and resamples many particle ﬁlters in the x-dimension. The ﬁlters in the x-dimension are an example of the random weight particle ﬁlter as in Fearnhead et al. (2010). On the other hand, the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) framework developed in Andrieu et al. (2010) allows us to design appropriate MCMC rejuvenation steps. Thus, the θ-particles target the correct posterior distribution at each iteration t, despite the intractability of the likelihood increments. We explore the applicability of our algorithm in both sequential and non-sequential applications and consider various degrees of freedom, as for example increasing dynamically the number of x-particles. We contrast our approach to various competing methods, both conceptually and empirically through a detailed simulation study, included here and in a supplement, and based on particularly challenging examples.},

	abstract = {Highly nonlinear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in ﬁelds such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases often display highly nonlinear dynamics. However, such models are problematic from the point of view of statistical inference. The deﬁning feature of chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are two main classes of methods for circumventing these difﬁculties: information reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic Likelihood, and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to compare the methods in order to reach conclusions about how to approach inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model misspeciﬁcation, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem, but, under the correct model and with sufﬁcient process noise, state space methods lead to substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different methods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning requirements, while for ﬁnal inference it is likely to be better to switch to a state space method, checking results against the information reduction approach.},

SMC sequentially updates a cloud of particles through a sequence of distributions, beginning with a distribution that is easy to sample from such as the prior and ending with the posterior distribution. Each update of the particle cloud consists of three steps: reweighting, resampling, and moving. In the move step, each particle is moved using a Markov kernel; this is typically the most computationally expensive part, particularly when the dataset is large. It is crucial to have an efﬁcient move step to ensure particle diversity. Our article makes two important contributions. First, in order to speed up the SMC computation, we use an approximately unbiased and efﬁcient annealed likelihood estimator based on data subsampling. The subsampling approach is more memory efﬁcient than the corresponding full data SMC, which is an advantage for parallel computation. Second, we use a Metropolis within Gibbs kernel with two conditional updates. A Hamiltonian Monte Carlo update makes distant moves for the model parameters, and a block pseudo-marginal proposal is used for the particles corresponding to the auxiliary variables for the data subsampling. We demonstrate both the usefulness and limitations of the methodology for estimating four generalized linear models and a generalized additive model with large datasets.},

              Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is a powerful technique originally developed for particle filtering and Bayesian inference. As a generic optimizer for statistical and nonstatistical objectives, its role is far less known. Density‐tempered SMC is a highly efficient sampling technique ideally suited for challenging global optimization problems and is implementable with a somewhat arbitrary initialization sampler instead of relying on a prior distribution. SMC optimization is anchored at the fact that all optimization tasks (continuous, discontinuous, combinatorial, or noisy objective function) can be turned into sampling under a density or probability function short of a norming constant. The point with the highest functional value is the SMC estimate for the maximum. Through examples, we systematically present various density‐tempered SMC algorithms and their superior performance vs. other techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Data cloning and
              k
              ‐fold duplication are two easily implementable accuracy accelerators, and their complementarity is discussed. The Extreme Value Theorem on the maximum order statistic can also help assess the quality of the SMC optimum. Our coverage includes the algorithmic essence of the density‐tempered SMC with various enhancements and solutions for (1) a bi‐modal nonstatistical function without and with constraints, (2) a multidimensional step function, (3) offline and online optimizations, (4) combinatorial variable selection, and (5) noninvertibility of the Hessian.

We develop new SMC methods with independent proposals which allow recycling of all candidates generated in the SMC process and are embarrassingly parallelisable. A novel evidence estimator that is easily computed from the output of our independent SMC is proposed. Our independent proposals are constructed via ﬂexible copula-type models calibrated with the population of SMC particles.

	abstract = {Density tempering (also called density annealing) is a sequential Monte Carlo approach to Bayesian inference for general state models; it is an alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo. When applied to state space models, it moves a collection of parameters and latent states (which are called particles) through a number of stages, with each stage having its own target distribution. The particles are initially generated from a distribution that is easy to sample from, e.g. the prior; the target at the final stage is the posterior distribution. Tempering is usually carried out either in batch mode, involving all the data at each stage, or sequentially with observations added at each stage, which is called data tempering. Our paper proposes efficient Markov moves for generating the parameters and states for each stage of particle based density tempering. This allows the proposed SMC methods to increase (scale up) the number of parameters and states that can be handled. Most of the current literature uses a pseudo-marginal Markov move step with the states integrated out, and the parameters generated by a random walk proposal; although this strategy is general, it is very inefficient when the states or parameters are high dimensional. We also build on the work of Dufays (2016) and make data tempering more robust to outliers and structural changes for models with intractable likelihoods by adding batch tempering at each stage. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using univariate stochastic volatility models with outliers and structural breaks and high dimensional factor stochastic volatility models having both many parameters and many latent states.},

Methods considering multiple possible nonlinear relationships among all variables remain sparse, hindered by challenges like overfitting and interpretation difficulties. This article examines the feasibility of applying such a method to psychological ILD, using the Regularization Algorithm under Marginality Principle (RAMP) alongside a local linearization method for interpretation. We evaluated its performance with simulated and empirical datasets using classification metrics, information criteria, and cross-validation. Results show this method often requires long series for satisfactory performance. While information criteria favor the nonlinear method in empirical datasets, cross-validation favors simpler AR models. Nonetheless, these challenges are comparable to those in linear idiographic modeling. Clear evidence of nonlinear relationships among variables supports the value of this method for exploratory studies. We developed an R package, quadVAR, as an implementation of this method.},

As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com) — an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality — we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts.

The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews.

                  Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a frequently used, flexible framework applied to many problems in statistical ecology. They are commonly used to incorporate smooth effects into models via splines, including spatial components in species distribution models.
                
                
                  
                    GAMs are often considered to be a purely frequentist framework (‘generalized linear models with wiggly bits’), however links between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to these models were highlighted early‐on in the literature. From a practical perspective, Bayesian thinking underlies many parts of the implementation in the popular R package
                    mgcv
                    , so understanding these underpinnings can be informative during model building and assessment.
                  
                
                
                  
                    This article aims to highlight useful links (and differences) between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to smoothing, as detailed in the statistical literature, in accessible way, with a focus on the
                    mgcv
                    implementation. By harnessing these links we can expand the set of modelling tools we have at our disposal, as well as our understanding of how existing methods work.
                  
                
                
                  Two important topics for quantitative ecologists are covered in detail: model term selection and uncertainty estimation. Taking Bayesian viewpoints for these problems makes them much more tractable in many applied settings.
